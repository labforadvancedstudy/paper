# Astrobiology

## Core Insight
Astrobiology studies life as a cosmic phenomenon - not just biology on Earth but the conditions, chemistry, and physics that allow complexity to emerge from simplicity anywhere in the universe.

Life as we know it requires liquid water, energy sources, and complex chemistry. But "as we know it" is a sample size of one. Astrobiology expands the search. Extremophiles on Earth thrive in conditions once thought lethal: boiling acid, nuclear reactors, miles underground. Each discovery expands life's possible habitats.

The field combines astronomy, biology, chemistry, and geology. Where do habitable planets form? How does prebiotic chemistry begin? Could life use solvents besides water? Silicon instead of carbon? The search includes our Solar System (Mars, Europa, Enceladus), exoplanets in habitable zones, and SETI. We study life's origin on Earth for clues about universal processes. Did life start at hydrothermal vents? In Darwin's "warm little pond"? From space? Understanding our beginning helps predict where else it might happen. Astrobiology asks the biggest question - are we alone? - using every scientific tool available.
