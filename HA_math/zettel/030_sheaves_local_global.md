# Sheaves and the Local-Global Principle

## Core Insight
Sheaves formalize the idea that global information can be reconstructed from local data - if the local pieces fit together consistently.

## Content
Think of a jigsaw puzzle: local pieces (with overlap information) determine the global picture. Sheaves make this precise for mathematical objects.

A sheaf assigns:
- To each open set U, data F(U)
- Restriction maps: F(U) → F(V) when V ⊂ U
- Local data that agrees on overlaps glues uniquely

Examples clarify:
- Continuous functions form a sheaf
- Differentiable functions form a sub-sheaf
- Constant functions don't form a sheaf!
- Solutions to differential equations often do

The power emerges:
- Local properties → global properties
- Obstructions to gluing measured by cohomology
- Exact sequences track information flow
- Spectral sequences compute cohomology

Key applications:
- Algebraic geometry: structure sheaf
- Complex analysis: holomorphic functions
- Differential geometry: vector bundles
- Number theory: étale cohomology

Grothendieck's insight: geometry is the study of sheaves on spaces.

Modern developments:
- Derived categories: sheaves up to homotopy
- Perverse sheaves: intersection cohomology
- D-modules: sheaves with differential equations
- Topos theory: sheaves as generalized spaces

Sheaves revealed that "local determines global" is a fundamental principle with precise meaning.
