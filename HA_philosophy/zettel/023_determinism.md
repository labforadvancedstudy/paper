# Determinism

## Core Insight
The clockwork universe - everything that happens must happen.

## Laplace's Demon

Give me the position and momentum of every particle, Laplace said, and I'll predict the entire future. The universe is a machine running on rails.

L1: Things have reasons
L2: Fate is written
L3: Chains of necessity
L4: Causal closure
L5: Physical determinism
L6: Statistical laws
L7: Soft determinism
L8: Computational paths
L9: Determinism/freedom unite

Quantum mechanics killed the demon. Or did it? Maybe randomness at the bottom, determinism at our scale. Maybe many worlds, all determined.
