# Color Feeling

## Core Insight
Colors bypass language and logic to strike directly at emotion - red doesn't mean anger, it creates a feeling that we've learned to call anger.

Before you knew color names, you felt them. The yellow of sunlight warming your face. The blue of sky opening above. The green of grass beneath bare feet. Colors arrived as sensations, not concepts.

This visceral color experience:
- Red quickens pulse (fire, blood, urgency) 
- Blue calms breathing (sky, water, distance)
- Yellow lifts mood (sun, warmth, energy)
- Green soothes eyes (nature, growth, rest)
- Purple intrigues (rare in nature, twilight)
- Orange energizes (fruit, sunset, vitality)

Babies respond to color before they understand anything else visual. It's pre-cognitive, pre-cultural. Yet each culture loads colors with meaning - white for death or purity, red for luck or danger. The feeling comes first, the meaning after.

Artists know: color is emotion's direct line. No translation needed. A painting can make you feel without showing any recognizable thing, just through color relationships. Rothko's color fields. Monet's light. They bypass the thinking mind.

Your body knows color. Your eyes dilate differently. Your skin responds. Your mood shifts. This is the raw material artists work with - not pigments, but the feelings pigments create.
