# Belief

## Core Insight
The mind's bet on reality - faith before evidence.

## The Believing Machine

We believe first, doubt later. Try not believing the words you're reading. You can't. Belief is default; skepticism takes effort.

L1: Trust immediate experience
L2: Faith in unseen
L3: Opinions and convictions
L4: Propositional attitudes
L5: Confidence levels
L6: Belief networks
L7: Ideology systems
L8: Bayesian updates
L9: Belief/doubt unity

The paradox: to doubt everything, you must believe in doubt.
