# Edge Computing AI

## Core Insight
Intelligence pushed to the periphery - AI running on phones, cameras, and chips, making decisions at the speed of reality without phoning home.

The cloud was supposed to centralize intelligence, but latency kills real-time applications. Self-driving cars can't wait for server responses. Privacy demands local processing. So intelligence migrates to edges - compressed models running on minimal hardware, making instant decisions with partial information.

This echoes biological evolution - intelligence distributed throughout nervous systems, not centralized in brains. Reflexes in spines, processing in retinas. Edge AI recreates this architecture: hierarchy of intelligence from cloud to edge to sensor. Intelligence becomes ambient, embedded everywhere.
