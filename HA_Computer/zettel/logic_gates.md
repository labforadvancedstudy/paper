# Logic Gates

## Core Insight
Transistors arranged into tiny philosophers - circuits that make logical decisions about electrical truths.

AND gate: Both inputs must be true. OR gate: Either input will do. NOT gate: Whatever you say, I say opposite. These are thoughts made from silicon. Aristotle's logic carved into crystal.

From these simple building blocks - just a handful of transistors each - we build arithmetic units, memories, entire processors. It's like discovering that all of mathematics can be built from "and," "or," and "not." Because it can.
