# Money

## Core Insight
Humanity's greatest invention: universal desire crystallized into transferable form - the ultimate abstraction.

Money is frozen want. It's the solution to barter's impossibility, the creation of liquid desire. From shells to gold to paper to bits, money is whatever we agree represents value.

Money functions as:
- **Medium of exchange** - universal translator of value
- **Store of value** - time machine for wealth
- **Unit of account** - measuring stick for worth
- **Standard of payment** - debt settler
- **Social technology** - cooperation enabler

Money's magic:
- Transforms specific into general (apples → dollars → anything)
- Travels through time (save now, spend later)
- Crosses space (transfer without transport)
- Scales infinitely (penny to trillion)
- Creates from nothing (fractional banking)

The profound truth: money is belief. It works because we believe it works. A dollar bill is worthless paper until collective faith makes it valuable. Money is humanity's most successful shared fiction.

From cowrie shells to cryptocurrency, money evolves but its essence remains: the tokenization of human effort and desire.
