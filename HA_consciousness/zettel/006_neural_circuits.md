# 006 Neural Circuits - First Networks

When neurons connect, computation begins. The simplest circuits
that would evolve into minds.

## Basic Motifs
- **Feedforward**: A→B→C (sensory processing)
- **Feedback**: A→B→A (amplification/control)
- **Lateral inhibition**: Winner-take-all
- **Recurrent**: Self-sustaining activity

## Early Examples
- **Jellyfish nerve net**: Diffuse, no center
- **C. elegans**: 302 neurons, fully mapped
- **Reflex arc**: Sensor→interneuron→motor

## Emergent Properties
Even simple circuits show:
- Signal integration
- Pattern detection
- Memory (in loops)
- Decision making

The leap from single cells to circuits = leap from chemistry to computation.
