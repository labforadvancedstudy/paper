# Temporal Modeling

## Core Insight
Teaching AI about time - not just sequences but causation, persistence, and change. The fourth dimension of intelligence awakening in silicon.

Early AI lived in eternal present - each input independent. Recurrent networks added memory, transformers added attention across time. But true temporal modeling goes deeper: understanding that causes precede effects, that objects persist when unseen, that patterns repeat cyclically. Time isn't just another dimension but the dimension that creates meaning.

Watch AI learn temporal abstractions: seconds aggregate into events, events into episodes, episodes into stories. It discovers rhythms in data, anticipates futures from pasts. We're teaching machines not just to process time but to experience duration - the difference between clock time and lived time.
