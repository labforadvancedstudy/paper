# Revolution

## Core Insight
The violent rewriting of political reality - when the accumulated pressure of contradiction explodes into system transformation.

Revolution is politics at the boiling point. The normal channels fail, legitimacy evaporates, and the fundamental question - who rules and why - gets answered with force.

The revolutionary moment is when the impossible becomes inevitable:
- Yesterday: "The king rules by divine right"
- Today: "The king has no right to rule"
- Tomorrow: "What king?"

Revolutions follow a strange physics:
- Long periods of stability (pressure building)
- Sudden cascade of events (criticality)
- Rapid transformation (phase transition)
- New equilibrium (different but similar)

The revolutionary paradox: to create a new order, the old must be destroyed. But destruction is easier than creation. Most revolutions devour their children, replacing one tyranny with another.

Yet revolutions reveal a deep truth: all political order is contingent. What seems permanent as mountains can vanish overnight. Power structures that lasted centuries can crumble in weeks.

The memory of revolution haunts all politics. Every state knows it could happen again. This knowledge shapes everything - constitutions include safety valves, rulers make concessions, citizens remember their ultimate power.
