# Corporate Personhood

## Core Insight
Legal fiction becomes social reality - by granting companies person-like rights, we created artificial beings that act in the world with agency but without human constraints.

The legal convenience enabled commerce. Corporations can contract, own property, sue and be sued. This abstraction lets capital aggregate and persist beyond human lifespans. But fiction has consequences. These "persons" accumulate power without mortality.

Corporate persons are strange beings. Immortal but not invulnerable. Conscious but not sentient. Purposeful but not moral. They act through humans but transcend them. They have rights but debate rages about responsibilities.

The philosophical puzzle deepens as companies grow more autonomous. AI-driven decisions, algorithmic management, automated operations - corporate persons gain agency independent of human intention. We created golems now writing their own instructions.
