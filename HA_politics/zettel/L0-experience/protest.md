# Protest

## Core Insight
Bodies in the street - the raw physical expression of political dissent, where private grievance becomes public demand.

You feel it first in your feet: the pavement, the walking, the standing. Then in your voice: chanting until hoarse. The sign gets heavy. You become aware of your body as political instrument.

The crowd has its own physics:
- Compression and expansion like breathing
- Sudden surges of movement
- The way energy ripples through
- How fear and courage are contagious

There's a moment when individual bodies become a collective body. You stop being "I" and become "we." Your grievance merges into our demand. The powerful thing: those watching can see the mass, feel its weight.

But also vulnerability: tear gas burns, batons hurt, arrests happen. The body that protests is the body that can be punished. This is why protest is brave - it puts flesh on the line.
