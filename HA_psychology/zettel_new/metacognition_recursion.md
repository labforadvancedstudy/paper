# Metacognition Recursion

## Core Insight
Thinking about thinking about thinking - consciousness is a mirror facing another mirror.

Humans do something weird: we observe our own observations. Not just "I'm angry" but "I notice I'm noticing I'm angry." This recursive loop might be consciousness itself - awareness aware of awareness. It's why meditation works: you step back and watch the watcher. But go too deep and you hit paradox: who's observing the observer observing? It's turtles all the way down.
