# Time Binding

## Core Insight
Humans are the only animal that lives in three tenses simultaneously - civilization is what we build in the gap between past and future.

Animals live in the eternal now. Humans live in yesterday, today, and tomorrow all at once. We carry our dead ancestors' knowledge and work for unborn descendants we'll never meet.

This time-binding creates civilization. Why plant seeds? Because future-you will eat. Why write books? Because future-strangers will read. Why build cathedrals taking centuries? Because the idea of completion matters more than seeing it.

Every human institution is time-binding crystallized. Laws bind past decisions to future actions. Traditions bind ancestral wisdom to descendant behavior. Civilization is a time machine we build by living in multiple moments simultaneously.
