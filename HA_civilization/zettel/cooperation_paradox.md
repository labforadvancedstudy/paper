# Cooperation Paradox

## Core Insight
The fundamental paradox of civilization: selfish genes created unselfish societies through the magic of recursive self-interest.

Evolution rewards selfishness. Help yourself, not others. Take, don't give. Yet humans build hospitals, die for strangers, share with the hungry. How did selfish replicators create altruistic civilizations?

The answer is beautiful: cooperation is selfish at a higher level. Help others today, they help you tomorrow. Reputation becomes currency. Altruism becomes investment. Being good is good business.

But it goes deeper. Once cooperation starts, it creates selection pressure for better cooperators. We evolved consciences, empathy, guilt - internal police enforcing external cooperation. Civilization hacked evolution, making selfishness create selflessness.
