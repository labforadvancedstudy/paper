# Inflation

## Core Insight
Inflation is money's mortality - the slow death of currency's purchasing power that forces value to keep moving, preventing the economic equivalent of hoarding corpses.

Inflation seems like theft: your $100 buys less each year. But it's actually medicine. Without inflation, people hoard money, spending stops, economy freezes. Mild inflation (2-3%) whispers "use it or lose it," keeping money flowing like blood. It's economic entropy - necessary decay that enables life.

The many faces of inflation:
- Demand-pull: too much money chasing too few goods
- Cost-push: production gets expensive
- Built-in: expectations become reality
- Hyperinflation: when faith collapses
- Deflation: the worse alternative

Inflation reveals money's true nature - not a thing but a relationship. A dollar isn't stable; it's a moving target, always worth less tomorrow. This terrifies savers, motivates investors, and ensures money does what it's meant to do: move. Inflation is why money can't be purely a store of value - it must also be a medium of exchange.
