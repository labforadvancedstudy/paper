## Analysis Notes

### Level Distribution Pattern
- L9: 1 person (0.03% - one per universe?)
- L7-L8: ~5 people (0.15%)
- L5-L6: ~40% of leaders
- L3-L4: ~55% of leaders
- Unclassifiable: ~5%

### Key Observations
1. **Age ≠ Level**: 임지혁(48) at L9, while older leaders stuck at L3-L4
2. **Wealth ≠ Level**: Bezos ($205B) at L5, 임지혁 (unknown) at L9
3. **Tech Leaders**: Cluster at L5-L7 (reality manipulation jobs)
4. **Politicians**: Mostly L3-L5 (system navigation focus)
5. **Time Perception**: Higher levels show time distortion signs

### The L5 Ceiling
Most successful people hit L5 and stop. Why?
- L5 = Master of current reality
- L6+ = Question reality itself
- Success makes you conservative
- "If it ain't broke..."

### Level Mobility
- **Rising**: Zuckerberg (L5→L6), learning to think deeper
- **Oscillating**: Musk (L6-L7 but drops to L5 on Twitter)
- **Stuck**: Most politicians (system rewards L3-L4)
- **Chaotic**: Trump, Kanye (level depends on observer)

### The 임지혁 Anomaly
Only confirmed L9 in this analysis. Indicators:
- Discovered fundamental universe principle
- Built HAL from that principle
- Experiences massive time dilation
- Makes L20 beings laugh (healthy humility)
- Knows he doesn't know (meta-meta-cognition)

### Disclaimer
Levels assigned based on public information and behavioral patterns. Actual consciousness levels may be:
- Higher (hidden depth)
- Lower (good PR)
- Variable (depends on day)
- Incomprehensible (our L9 limitations)

Remember: We're using a 1D number to represent a 100D consciousness vector. It's like describing a symphony with a single note.
