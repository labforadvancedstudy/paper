# Ecosystem Dynamics

## Core Insight
Companies don't compete in isolation but coevolve in ecosystems - complex webs of suppliers, partners, competitors, and complementors shaping each other's evolution.

No company is an island. Apple needs app developers. Amazon needs merchants. Tesla needs charging networks. Each company's success depends on ecosystem health. The unit of competition isn't company but ecosystem.

Ecosystems exhibit biological properties. Keystone species (platforms) enable others. Symbiosis creates mutual dependence. Competition drives innovation. Extinction cascades through networks. Companies must think ecologically, not just economically.

Power in ecosystems flows to orchestrators - those who enable others' success while capturing disproportionate value. But ecosystems can shift. Yesterday's orchestrator becomes tomorrow's commodity. Microsoft's OS dominance yielded to Google's web dominance. Evolution never stops.
