# Collective Consciousness

## Core Insight
The emergence of group mind - when many individual consciousnesses synchronize into patterns of thought and feeling that exist above any single person.

Politics isn't just about individuals choosing. Something happens when people gather, communicate, resonate. A crowd has moods. A nation has memories. A movement has will. These aren't metaphors - they're emergent realities.

Manifestations of collective consciousness:
- The "mood" of an era (optimistic 1960s, cynical 1970s)
- National "character" (real or imagined)
- The "spirit" of a movement
- Mass hysteria and moral panics
- Collective trauma and healing
- The "zeitgeist" (spirit of the time)

This isn't mystical - it's systemic. When information flows between minds, when emotions spread through networks, when people coordinate their attention, something greater than individual consciousness emerges.

Media technology shapes collective consciousness:
- Print: national consciousness
- Radio: mass synchronization
- TV: shared visual reality
- Internet: fragmented tribes
- Social media: viral cascades

The political implications are profound. Democracy assumes individuals making rational choices. But if consciousness is collective, if thoughts and feelings cascade through networks, if we think together more than alone - then politics is psychodynamics at scale.

Collective consciousness can be liberation (solidarity, empathy across difference) or prison (groupthink, mob mentality). The question: how do we cultivate healthy collective consciousness?
