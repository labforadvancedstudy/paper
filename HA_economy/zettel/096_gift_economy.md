# Gift Economy

## Core Insight
Gift economies reveal markets aren't the only way to organize exchange - gifts create relationships and obligations that bind communities together through reciprocity rather than price.

Anthropologists found them everywhere. Pacific islanders circulating shells. Native Americans potlatching blankets. Even today - open source software, Wikipedia, academic papers - massive value created and given away. Why?

Gifts work differently than commodities. A commodity exchange ends when paid - we're even. A gift creates obligation - you owe reciprocity. Commodities enable independence. Gifts create interdependence. Markets make strangers of us. Gifts make family.

The logic inverts. In markets, hoarding makes you rich. In gift economies, giving makes you rich - in status, relationships, security. The most generous have the most social capital. Power comes not from having but from having given.

But gifts aren't free. They carry invisible strings - expectations, obligations, power dynamics. The gift of aid can create dependence. The gift of code can build reputation capital. Even generosity can be strategic.

Modern economy hybridizes. Freemium gives away basic, sells premium. Social media gives away platform, sells attention. The gift draws you into relationship, then monetizes it. We're rediscovering gifts as customer acquisition.

The deeper question: could gift logic scale? Could an economy run on generosity instead of greed? Or are gifts forever limited to small communities where reputation matters and reciprocity is enforceable?
