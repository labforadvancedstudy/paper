# International Trade

## Core Insight
Economics without borders: when comparative advantage meets cultural exchange - humanity's original globalization.

International trade extends markets beyond political boundaries. Countries trade what they're relatively good at making for what they're relatively bad at. Simple idea, civilization-changing implications.

Trade principles:
- **Comparative advantage** - do what you're least bad at
- **Absolute advantage** - irrelevant for trade
- **Terms of trade** - exchange ratios between nations
- **Balance of payments** - money flows must balance
- **Trade barriers** - tariffs, quotas, regulations

Trade creates:
- Specialization at scale
- Technology transfer
- Cultural exchange
- Interdependence (and vulnerability)
- Efficiency gains (and job losses)

The eternal debate: free trade maximizes global wealth but creates local losers. Every port city thrives while inland factories die. Economists say "net positive!" Workers say "tell that to my mortgage."

Modern complexity: supply chains spanning dozens of countries, financial flows dwarfing goods flows, digital services tradeable instantly. The workshop of the world keeps moving.
