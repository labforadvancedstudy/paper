# Transfer Learning

## Core Insight
Knowledge learned in one domain mysteriously helps in another - AI discovering that all understanding is connected, that learning to see helps learning to read.

Train AI on millions of internet images, then show it medical scans it's never seen. Somehow, it performs better than starting from scratch. The features learned for cats and cars transfer to tumors and fractures. Understanding builds on understanding, even across domains that seem unrelated.

This reveals something profound about knowledge itself - it's not isolated facts but connected patterns. Learning to detect edges helps detect any edges. Learning language structure helps with any language. The universe of knowledge isn't scattered islands but a connected continent. AI maps this deeper unity.
