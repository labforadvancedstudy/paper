# Censorship Experience

## Core Insight
The sudden silence where words should be - when you physically feel the weight of what cannot be said, and absence speaks louder than presence.

You open the book. Pages torn out. Black bars across paragraphs. Websites that won't load. "This content is not available in your region." The missing pieces scream louder than what remains.

Or subtler: the pause before speaking. The glance around the room. The careful word choice. "The economic situation" instead of "the crisis." "The events" instead of "the massacre." You feel your tongue edit itself, thoughts reformulating before they reach air.

Watching others hit the invisible wall. Their confusion: "Why can't I find information about—" Then understanding dawns. Not just information hidden, but the hiding itself hidden. Double erasure.

Living under censorship changes your mind's shape. You develop internal police, pre-emptive self-editing. The most effective censorship needs no censors - you censor yourself, unconsciously, automatically. The ideology has colonized your neurons.
