# Problem of Evil

## Core Insight
The rock on which all theodicy breaks: if God is good and all-powerful, why do children suffer?

This isn't abstract philosophy but visceral contradiction. Stand in a children's cancer ward and try to reconcile omnipotent love with reality. The problem of evil is where systematic theology meets its limit.

The classical formulation:
1. God is omnipotent (can prevent evil)
2. God is omniscient (knows about evil)
3. God is omnibenevolent (wants to prevent evil)
4. Evil exists
∴ Contradiction

The attempted solutions multiply:
- **Free will defense** - evil is price of freedom
- **Soul-making theodicy** - suffering creates character
- **Greater good** - evil serves hidden purpose
- **Cosmic conflict** - devil/demons cause evil
- **Karma/justice** - suffering is deserved
- **Mystery** - we can't understand divine plans

But watch a mother hold her dying child. Tell her about free will. Explain soul-making. The theories crumble before the fact.

The problem of evil isn't solved but lived with. Faith either breaks here or transforms into something that includes tragedy. The cross is Christianity's admission: God suffers too. Buddhism's first noble truth: life is suffering. The problem incorporated rather than solved.
