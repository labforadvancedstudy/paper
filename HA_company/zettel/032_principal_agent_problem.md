# Principal Agent Problem

## Core Insight
The principal-agent problem is organizational original sin - the inevitable misalignment between those who own (principals) and those who operate (agents), creating friction at every level.

Shareholders want returns, managers want bonuses. Managers want results, employees want work-life balance. Every delegation creates potential conflict. Interests diverge. Information asymmetries emerge. The agent knows more but cares less about principal outcomes.

Companies try aligning through incentives: stock options, bonuses, monitoring. But perfect alignment proves impossible. Every incentive creates unintended behaviors. Metrics become targets. Goodhart's law rules: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."

The problem recurses fractally. CEOs are agents to boards. Boards are agents to shareholders. In public companies, even shareholders are agents to beneficial owners. It's agency problems all the way down. Trust and verification dance eternal tension.
