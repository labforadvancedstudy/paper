# Cosmic Location

## Core Insight
Our Solar System occupies a privileged position in space and time - far enough from danger to be safe, close enough to resources to thrive, existing in the brief cosmic window when galaxies shine and life is possible.

We orbit a medium star in the Orion Arm, between major spiral arms of the Milky Way. Not in the crowded, radiation-soaked galactic center. Not in the empty halo. But in the suburbs - dense enough for element enrichment from previous supernovae, sparse enough to avoid frequent catastrophes. Our Sun formed after enough stellar generations to accumulate heavy elements needed for rocky planets and life.

Zoom out further: we exist during the Stelliferous Era, when stars shine and planets can be warm. Earlier, no heavy elements. Later, no new stars. We occupy a fleeting moment in cosmic history when complexity is possible. Location in space, location in time - both had to be right. We're not just on Earth, in the Solar System, in the Milky Way. We're in the only known sweet spot of space and time where consciousness could emerge to appreciate it all.
