# Planets as Dots

## Core Insight
Planets hide in plain sight among the stars - wandering dots that ancient skywatchers noticed move, teaching us that not all lights in heaven are equal.

To casual observers, planets are just bright stars. But watch night after night, and some "stars" drift against the stellar background. The Greeks called them "wanderers" - planetai. These five visible dots - Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn - move with purpose, sometimes reversing direction, as if dancing to unheard music.

Venus blazes as morning or evening star, so bright it casts shadows. Mars glows red like a distant ember. Jupiter shines steady and strong. These aren't just points of light but worlds masquerading as stars, close enough to reflect sunlight, far enough to seem eternal. The wanderers taught humanity that the sky has depth, that celestial objects exist at different distances, that we're part of a system.
