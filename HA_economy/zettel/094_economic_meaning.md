# Economic Meaning

## Core Insight
Beyond production and consumption lies the deepest economic question - what is it all for? Economics describes how we allocate resources, but meaning asks why we bother.

Traditional economics dodges meaning. It takes preferences as given, studies how to satisfy them efficiently, but never asks whether the preferences are worth satisfying. GDP measures everything except what makes life worthwhile.

Yet meaning pervades economics. Why do people work beyond subsistence? Not just for money but for purpose, identity, contribution. Why do we trade? Not just for goods but for connection, reciprocity, mutual recognition. Economy isn't just resource flow but meaning flow.

Consider the paradox of prosperity. Rich societies have more depression than poor ones. Lottery winners aren't happier after a year. Above basic needs, wealth correlates weakly with wellbeing. We're optimizing the wrong function.

The meaning crisis intersects economics. Bullshit jobs proliferate - roles that create no value but employ millions. Consumer culture promises meaning through purchases but delivers emptiness. We work to buy things we don't need to impress people we don't like.

Alternative economies explore different meanings. Gift economies prioritize relationships. Commons emphasize sharing. Time banks value everyone's hour equally. Each embeds different assumptions about what matters.

The ultimate economic question isn't how to produce more but what to produce for. Not how to grow but why to grow. Not efficiency but purpose. Economics without meaning is a machine running perfectly toward nowhere.
