# Staging

## Core Insight
Throwing away your own body parts to go faster - the counterintuitive strategy of discarding expensive hardware mid-flight because dead weight is the enemy of acceleration.

Staging is the rocket equation's loophole. Since you need exponentially more fuel for linear velocity gains, the solution is brutally simple: discard the empty tanks and engines you no longer need. It's like climbing a mountain by building the path from pieces of your backpack, then leaving them behind.

Why staging works:
- Empty tanks are parasitic mass
- First stage engines optimized for sea level
- Upper stage engines optimized for vacuum
- Each stage has ideal mass ratio
- Cumulative effect beats single stage

The staging moment is violence:
- Explosive bolts fire
- Stages separate at kilometers/second
- Retro rockets prevent recontact
- First stage falls back (or lands)
- Upper stage lights in seconds
- G-forces jump as mass drops

Staging strategies:
- Serial: Traditional stacked stages
- Parallel: Boosters alongside core
- Asparagus: Crossfeed complexity
- Drop tanks: Partial staging
- Stage-and-a-half: Engine clustering

The reusability revolution changes everything:
- First stages now land and fly again
- Recovery hardware adds mass penalty
- Refurbishment vs replacement economics
- Reliability must increase 100x

Staging embodies space engineering philosophy: every gram matters, perfection is too heavy, and sometimes the best solution is to throw expensive things away (or catch them).
