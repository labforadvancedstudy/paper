# Commons Tragedy

## Core Insight
The tragedy of the commons reveals the dark mathematics of shared resources - when everyone owns something, no one protects it, and rational individuals collectively create irrational outcomes.

Garrett Hardin painted the picture: a shared pasture, multiple herders. Each herder gains the full benefit of adding one more cow but shares the cost of overgrazing with everyone. Rational choice: add another cow. Collective result: destroyed pasture, starving cows, ruined herders.

The tragedy plays out everywhere. Overfishing: each boat's rational catch depletes the fishery. Climate change: each country's rational emissions cook the planet. Antibiotic resistance: each prescription makes sense, collectively creates superbugs. Traffic: each car's rational route creates gridlock.

Traditional solutions involve privatization (assign ownership) or regulation (limit use). But neither works for global commons like atmosphere or oceans. Who owns the sky? Which government controls the high seas?

Elinor Ostrom found a third way: communities managing commons through evolved norms, monitoring, and sanctions. Not top-down regulation or pure privatization, but collective self-governance. It works... sometimes. When groups are small, stable, and share values.

The digital age creates new commons and new tragedies. Information wants to be free but creators need payment. Social media commons get polluted by misinformation. Attention commons get overgrazed by notification addiction.

The tragedy of the commons isn't just about resources - it's about the fundamental tension between individual and collective rationality.
