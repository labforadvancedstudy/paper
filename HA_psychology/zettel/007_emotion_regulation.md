# Emotion Regulation

Managing the feels.

Strategies:
- Suppression: Hide it (costs energy)
- Reappraisal: Reframe it (more effective)
- Distraction: Look away
- Acceptance: Let it be

Timing matters:
- Before: Situation selection
- During: Attention deployment
- After: Response modulation

Individual differences:
Some natural regulators.
Others struggle lifelong.

Teachable skill.
