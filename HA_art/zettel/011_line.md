# Line

## Core Insight
The path of a moving point - the most basic element that contains infinite expression, from delicate whisper to violent scream.

Line is mark with direction. It's the trail left by movement, the record of gesture, the boundary between this and that. Give anyone a pencil and they make lines. It's how we first draw - mommy is a circle with stick legs.

Line varieties are endless:
- **Quality**: rough/smooth, thick/thin, dark/light
- **Direction**: horizontal (calm), vertical (aspiring), diagonal (dynamic)
- **Character**: nervous, confident, searching, decisive
- **Function**: outline, contour, gesture, hatching

Line is both edge and energy:
- Defines shapes (where form stops)
- Creates movement (eye follows)
- Implies texture (how it's made)
- Conveys emotion (how it feels)
- Builds form (accumulation creates volume)

The masters knew: line is never just line. 
- Rembrandt's line: humanity in every stroke
- Picasso's line: essence in minimum
- Basquiat's line: raw nerve exposed
- Hokusai's line: nature's own gesture

Line is drawing's DNA. Change the line, change everything. It's the most direct path from inner state to outer form - which is why graphologists read personality in handwriting. We are how we line.
