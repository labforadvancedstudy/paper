# Schema Violation: Expectation Breaks

**Core Concept**: When reality violates our mental templates, we experience surprise and enhanced memory.

## One-Line Definition
Your brain stutters when the world doesn't match its predictions - that stutter creates lasting impressions.

## Simple Mental Model
Like autocorrect expecting one word and you type another - the system has to stop, reassess, and update.

## Key Mechanism
1. Schema sets expectation
2. Reality contradicts schema
3. Prediction error signal fires
4. Enhanced encoding and schema update

## Practical Example
Restaurant schema: order, eat, pay. But this restaurant makes you pay first, eat later. The violation makes you remember this place forever - your brain marked it "UNUSUAL!"

## Common Misconception
Schemas are rigid stereotypes. Actually, they're flexible prediction machines - violations don't break them, they trigger updates and evolution.
