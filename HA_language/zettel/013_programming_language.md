# Programming Language

## Core Insight
Language for machines - precise, unambiguous instructions that create behavior.

## The New Species Speaks

1950s: Humans create a new kind of language user - computers. These beings need language without ambiguity, metaphor, or context. Pure logic in symbolic form.

Evolution of code:
L1: Machine code (binary: 01001000)
L2: Assembly (MOV AX, BX)
L3: Procedural (C: for loops)
L4: Object-oriented (Java: classes)
L5: Functional (Haskell: pure functions)
L6: Declarative (SQL: what, not how)
L7: Natural language programming (GPT coding)

Key differences from human language:
- No ambiguity allowed
- Context-free grammar
- Explicit typing (usually)
- Deterministic interpretation
- No pragmatics

Yet programming languages evolve like natural ones:
- Syntax borrowed and mutated
- Communities develop idioms
- "Dead" languages (COBOL lives!)
- Language wars (worse than human ones)
