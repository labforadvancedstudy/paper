# Science Fiction

## Core Insight
Science fiction is humanity's thought experiment laboratory - where we imagine interstellar civilizations before we can build them, exploring the possibilities and perils through stories.

Before we can travel to the stars, we travel there in our minds. Science fiction isn't just entertainment - it's preparation. Every story about galactic empires, first contact, or colony ships is a rehearsal for a possible future.

The sci-fi experience:
- Star Trek's optimistic Federation
- Star Wars' ancient galactic civilization  
- The Expanse's realistic space politics
- Asimov's Foundation planning millennia ahead
- Contact's philosophical first meeting
- Interstellar's desperate escape from dying Earth

These stories shape our expectations. They give us vocabulary: "warp drive," "generation ship," "prime directive," "galactic empire." They let us experience the emotional reality of interstellar civilization before the technical reality arrives.

Most importantly, sci-fi asks the questions: What happens to humanity spread across light-years? How do we stay human? What do we become? Every story is a simulation of possibility.
