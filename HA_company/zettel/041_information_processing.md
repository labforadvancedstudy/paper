# Information Processing

## Core Insight
Companies are information processing systems - taking in data, transforming it through collective computation, outputting decisions and products that reshape reality.

Every company is a computer made of humans and machines. Sensors (employees, systems) gather data. Processors (meetings, analysis) transform information. Memory (documents, culture) stores patterns. Outputs (decisions, products) affect environment. It's computation at organizational scale.

The processing transcends individual cognition. No single mind holds the company's knowledge. Information flows through human networks, technical systems, cultural patterns. The company "knows" things no employee knows. It computes answers no individual could reach.

As companies digitize, they become literal computers. Algorithms make decisions. AI processes information. Automation executes instructions. The boundary between company-as-computer-metaphor and company-as-actual-computer dissolves. We're building thinking organizations.
