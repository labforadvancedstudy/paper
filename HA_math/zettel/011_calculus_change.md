# Calculus and the Mathematics of Change

## Core Insight
Calculus captures the paradox of motion - how things change in an instant that has no duration.

## Content
Zeno's paradox haunted mathematics: how can an arrow move if at each instant it's stationary? Calculus answered by embracing the paradox: we study change by freezing it.

Two sides of the same coin:
- Differentiation: finding instantaneous rate of change
- Integration: accumulating infinitesimal changes

The derivative asks: "If we zoom in infinitely close, what's the slope?"
- Position → velocity
- Velocity → acceleration  
- Any curve → tangent line at a point

The integral asks: "If we add up infinite infinitesimals, what's the total?"
- Velocity → distance traveled
- Density → total mass
- Any rate → accumulated quantity

The Fundamental Theorem connects them: differentiation and integration are inverses. This isn't obvious - it's miraculous. Local information (derivatives) reconstructs global information (integrals).

Calculus revealed that:
- Smooth change can be analyzed
- Infinity can be tamed through limits
- Physics speaks calculus naturally
- Optimization needs derivatives

Newton needed calculus for gravity. Leibniz saw it philosophically. Both were right - calculus is both tool and truth.
