# 017 Global Workspace - Broadcasting Info

Consciousness as neural fame. Information becomes conscious
when globally broadcast.

## Theory (Baars/Dehaene)
- Multiple specialized processors (unconscious)
- Limited capacity workspace
- Competition for access
- Global broadcast = consciousness

## Neural Implementation
- Prefrontal-parietal network
- Long-range connections
- Sustained firing
- Ignition: Local → global activity

## Properties
- Serial processing (one thing at a time)
- Flexible routing
- Working memory overlap
- Reportability

## Evidence
- Attentional blink: Workspace bottleneck
- Binocular rivalry: Winner takes workspace
- Masking: Prevents global ignition
- P3b wave: EEG signature of access

When information goes global, the lights turn on.
