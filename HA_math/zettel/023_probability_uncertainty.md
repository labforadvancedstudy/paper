# Probability and the Mathematics of Uncertainty

## Core Insight
Probability transforms uncertainty from an obstacle into an object of study - making precise statements about what we don't know.

## Content
Probability began with gambling but became the language of uncertainty itself. When we can't know for certain, we can still know probabilities.

The basics seem simple:
- Outcomes and events
- P(event) between 0 and 1
- P(certain) = 1, P(impossible) = 0
- P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

But subtlety emerges:
- Conditional probability: P(A|B) - updating beliefs
- Independence: P(A and B) = P(A)×P(B)
- Bayes' theorem: reversing conditionals
- Law of large numbers: averages converge

Interpretations divide:
- Frequentist: probability is long-run frequency
- Bayesian: probability is degree of belief
- Propensity: probability is physical tendency
- Each leads to different mathematics

Modern probability is measure theory:
- Sample space Ω
- σ-algebra of events
- Probability measure P
- Random variables as functions

Applications everywhere:
- Quantum mechanics: fundamental randomness
- Statistics: inference from data
- Finance: pricing under uncertainty
- Machine learning: probabilistic models

Probability revealed that uncertainty has structure - and that structure is mathematics.
