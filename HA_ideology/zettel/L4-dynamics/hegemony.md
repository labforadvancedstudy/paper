# Hegemony

## Core Insight
Domination through consent - when the ruled embrace the rulers' worldview as common sense, making force unnecessary because the oppressed police themselves.

Gramsci's genius insight: power isn't just guns and laws. It's getting people to want what you want them to want. Hegemony operates through:
- Common sense (making ideology seem natural)
- Cultural leadership (defining good, beautiful, true)
- Institutional control (schools, media, churches)
- Intellectual production (whose ideas circulate)
- Moral authority (what's considered ethical)

The hegemonic class doesn't impose its ideology. It leads society to accept that ideology as reality itself. "That's just how things are." "There is no alternative." "It's human nature." These aren't arguments - they're hegemony speaking.

Hegemony is always incomplete, always contested:
- Organic intellectuals arise from dominated classes
- Counter-hegemonic projects challenge common sense
- Crisis moments reveal ideology as ideology
- Subaltern groups maintain alternative worldviews
- New conditions create new possibilities

The struggle for hegemony precedes political victory. Win the culture war first, then political power follows. Change how people think about what's possible, natural, good - then changing society becomes inevitable.

Modern hegemony operates through:
- Neoliberalism ("market logic" for everything)
- Individualism (social problems need personal solutions)
- Meritocracy (inequality reflects worth)
- Technology solutionism (apps will save us)

Breaking hegemony requires patient work: education, organization, alternative institutions, new common sense.
