# Statistics and Finding Patterns in Noise

## Core Insight
Statistics extracts signal from noise - the art of making confident statements about populations from limited samples.

## Content
If probability handles uncertainty going forward, statistics reasons backward: from data to the process that generated it. This inverse problem is harder and deeper.

Core concepts:
- Population: what we want to know about
- Sample: what we actually observe
- Estimator: function from sample to guess
- Bias and variance: two types of error

The fundamental tension:
- More complex models fit data better
- But might not generalize
- Occam's razor formalized
- Bias-variance tradeoff

Key tools:
- Mean and variance: center and spread
- Hypothesis testing: is this pattern real?
- Confidence intervals: how sure are we?
- p-values: probability under null hypothesis

But p-values caused crisis:
- p < 0.05 became ritual
- p-hacking: torture data until it confesses
- Replication crisis: most findings don't replicate
- Bayesian methods offer alternative

Modern statistics:
- Machine learning: finding patterns automatically
- Causal inference: correlation isn't causation
- High dimensions: more variables than samples
- Bootstrap: resampling for uncertainty

Statistics revealed that data speaks - but only if we ask the right questions and listen carefully.
