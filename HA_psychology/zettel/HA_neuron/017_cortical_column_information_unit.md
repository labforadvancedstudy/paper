# 017_cortical_column_information_unit

## The Fundamental Unit of Thought

Cortical columns represent a stunning discovery:
the cortex is built from repeated units,
each a complete information processor.

### The Columnar Architecture
- ~100,000 neurons per column
- Six layers, each with distinct function
- Input, processing, and output in miniature
- The "microchip" of the brain

### Universal Computation
- Same structure in visual, auditory, motor cortex
- Suggests universal cortical algorithm
- What makes vision different from hearing?
- Only the inputs, not the processing

### Hierarchical Processing
- Layer 4: Receives thalamic input
- Layers 2/3: Local processing
- Layer 5: Output to subcortical structures
- Layer 6: Feedback to thalamus
- Information flows up and down

### The Consciousness Implication
Columns suggest:
- Consciousness built from modular units
- Same computation creates different qualia
- The substrate of unified experience
