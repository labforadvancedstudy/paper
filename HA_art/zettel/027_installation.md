# Installation

## Core Insight
Art as environment - where viewers enter the work rather than observe it, transforming gallery space into experience space, making the container part of the content.

Installation art refuses the frame. Instead of objects in space, space itself becomes medium:
- Site-specific: work exists only in particular place
- Immersive: surrounds viewer completely
- Interactive: viewer participation completes work
- Temporal: exists for duration, then memory
- Architectural: walls, floor, ceiling activated

Elements combine into environment:
- Objects arranged in space
- Light shaping perception
- Sound creating atmosphere
- Smell triggering memory
- Temperature affecting comfort
- Time changing experience

Installation democratized museum space. No longer neutral white cube but active participant. James Turrell's light chambers. Yayoi Kusama's infinity rooms. Viewer's body completes work through movement, perception, presence.

Documentation problem haunts installation:
- Photographs flatten space
- Video misses periphery
- VR tries but lacks body
- Memory becomes primary record
- Experience resists reproduction

Contemporary installation trends:
- Instagram-optimized experiences (problem?)
- Participatory/relational aesthetics
- Technology integration (sensors, projection)
- Eco-installations using living systems
- Virtual installations in game engines

Temporary nature questions art market. Can't sell space itself (usually). Instead: documentation, certificates, instructions for recreation. Collectors buy potential rather than object.
