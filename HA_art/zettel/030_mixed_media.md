# Mixed Media

## Core Insight
The refusal to choose - where materials converse across categories, creating hybrid forms that mirror our fragmented, multimedia reality.

Mixed media acknowledges truth: purity is fiction. Always already hybrid:
- Oil paint contains minerals, oils, solvents
- "Pure" photography uses chemicals, paper, light
- Digital requires hardware, electricity, minerals
- Every medium already multiple

But mixed media celebrates mixture:
- Paint meets collage meets photograph
- Sculpture incorporates video
- Drawing on top of prints
- Physical objects in digital space
- Sound in visual installation

Historical resistance strong:
- Painting purists rejected collage
- Photographers fought digital
- Sculptors suspicious of technology
- Each generation defending boundaries

Contemporary art assumes mixture:
- Instagram posts as mixed media
- AR filters on paintings
- 3D printed painted sculptures
- AI-generated textures on canvas
- Blockchain verified physical works

Methods merge:
- Scan, print, paint, photograph, repeat
- Traditional skills meet digital tools
- Ancient techniques with new materials
- East/West processes combined
- High/low materials together

Mixed media mirrors mind - we don't think in single channels. Memory mixes sensory data. Dreams combine impossibly. Consciousness itself mixed media. Art follows.

Challenge: when everything's possible, what chooses? Constraint breeds creativity. Total freedom paralyzed. Best mixed media has reason - materials serve idea, not vice versa.
