# Economics of Everything

## Core Insight
Economic thinking colonizes all human domains - every choice becomes cost-benefit, every relationship becomes transaction, every value gets a price, until economics explains everything and understands nothing.

Gary Becker started it. Economics of crime (do crime if benefits exceed costs). Economics of marriage (utility maximization with spouse). Economics of discrimination (taste for prejudice has a price). Suddenly, economics wasn't just about markets but all human behavior.

The logic spreads everywhere. Education becomes human capital investment. Children become durable goods. Religion provides insurance against existential risk. Love is mutual utility enhancement. Even suicide gets economic analysis - when expected lifetime utility goes negative.

This imperialism has power. It clarifies hidden trades-offs. Makes implicit costs explicit. Reveals incentives behind noble rhetoric. Shows how self-interest drives altruism. Strips away romanticism to show calculation.

But something is lost. When everything has economics, nothing has sanctity. When all is transaction, gift disappears. When every choice is optimization, spontaneity dies. The economic lens, so powerful for seeing some things, blinds us to others.

Worse, the model becomes prescription. Told we're homo economicus, we become it. Taught to see relationships as exchanges, we do. The map doesn't just describe territory - it reshapes it.

The deepest question: is there anything that shouldn't be subjected to economic analysis? Or in understanding everything economically, do we understand nothing humanly?
