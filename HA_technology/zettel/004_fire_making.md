# Fire Making

## Core Insight
Fire is controlled chemical reaction - humanity's first mastery over molecular processes, turning destruction into tool.

Fire making separates us from every other species. Not using fire - many animals flee toward fire's warmth or cooking effect. But MAKING fire - that's uniquely human. It's controlled release of solar energy stored in matter.

The profound act: taking what nature uses to destroy and domesticating it. Fire in the wild consumes. Fire in the hearth serves. Same reaction, different context. Control makes the difference.

From first spark to nuclear reactor, we're still just managing energetic reactions. Fire taught us the fundamental technology pattern: identify force, contain force, direct force, profit. Every engine is fire's descendant.
