# Capitalism

## Core Insight
Capitalism is evolution applied to economics - a system that harnesses human self-interest and competitive pressure to create an explosion of innovation, wealth, and inequality that transforms societies faster than any planned system could.

Capitalism isn't an ideology - it's an algorithm: private property + free exchange + profit motive = emergent organization. Like evolution, it's amoral, efficient, and creative. It doesn't care about justice, beauty, or meaning - only what survives market selection. This blindness is both its greatest strength and deepest flaw.

The system's genius and horror:
- Turns greed into goods (invisible hand)
- Creates wealth but concentrates it
- Innovates relentlessly but destroys ruthlessly
- Solves problems by creating new ones
- Efficient at production, wasteful of humans

Capitalism is the economic water we swim in - so pervasive it feels like nature rather than choice. But it's just one answer to "how should we organize resources?" Its dominance doesn't prove it's optimal, only that it's viral. Like democracy, it's the worst system except for all the others we've tried.
