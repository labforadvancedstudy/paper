# Money Invention

## Core Insight
Money is crystallized trust - transforming social debt into universal, portable, countable tokens.

Before money: "I gave you three chickens, you owe me." But what if I don't need what you have? What if you die? What if we forget? Debt was personal, local, fragile.

Money says: "This token represents value itself." Not chickens, not labor, but pure, abstract value. It's meaningless - just metal or paper or bits. But if we all pretend together, it becomes real.

Money enables strangers to cooperate. I don't need to trust you personally - I trust the money. It's civilization's lubricant, letting millions of humans work together without knowing each other.

But money also quantifies everything. Your time has a price. Your life has a price. Sacred things become commodities. Money doesn't just measure value - it redefines what value means.
