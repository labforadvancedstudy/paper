# Law Behavior Compiler

Social norms: Implicit, local, fuzzy.
Law: Explicit, universal, precise.

Law compiles desired behavior into executable social code:
- Natural language → Legal language
- Intentions → Enforcements  
- Values → Punishments

Civilization runs on this OS.
Bugs in law = social exploits.
