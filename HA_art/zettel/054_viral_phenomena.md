# Viral Phenomena

## Core Insight
Contagion as culture - where ideas spread like pathogens through networks, creating instant global phenomena that burn bright and often fade fast, rewriting how culture propagates.

Viral mechanics operate:
- Emotional trigger essential
- Simplicity enables sharing
- Timing unpredictable
- Authenticity performed
- Algorithms amplify

Art world virality:
- Banana duct-taped wall
- Shredded Banksy
- Bean sculpture selfies
- Museum date videos
- NFT mania moments

Characteristics shared:
- Memeable quality
- Controversy courted
- Accessibility immediate
- Participation invited
- Documentation prioritized

Speed changes everything:
- Global awareness instant
- Context collapses
- Nuance impossible
- Backlash immediate
- Memory shortened

Artists adapt strategies:
- Design for sharing
- Controversy calculated
- Hashtags essential
- Influencer collaboration
- Platform native thinking

Problems multiply:
- Substance vs. spectacle
- Attention addiction
- Metrics misleading
- Burnout accelerated
- Copycats instant

Yet virality democratizes:
- Unknown artists discovered
- Gatekeepers bypassed
- Audiences expanded
- Conversations sparked
- Culture accelerated

Question: Does viral equal valuable? Attention doesn't equal understanding. Sharing doesn't mean caring. Views don't create meaning. But ignored art impacts nobody. Balance needed.
