# Quantum Chemistry

## Core Insight
Chemistry emerges from quantum mechanics - electron wavefunctions overlap, interfere, and create the illusion of solid matter and discrete bonds.

The chemical bond doesn't exist. There are only wavefunctions overlapping, electron densities redistributing. When hydrogen atoms approach, their 1s orbitals merge into bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals. The bonding orbital lowers energy - we call this a "bond."

Schrödinger's equation rules everything. Solve it for H₂⁺ (simplest molecule), you get exact chemistry. For anything bigger, approximations necessary. But the principle holds: chemistry is applied quantum mechanics, electrons obeying wave equations.

Heisenberg uncertainty means electrons have no definite position. Orbitals are probability clouds. s-orbitals spherical, p-orbitals dumbell-shaped - these shapes aren't electron paths but probability distributions. Chemistry happens where probabilities overlap.
