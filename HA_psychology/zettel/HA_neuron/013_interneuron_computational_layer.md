# 013_interneuron_computational_layer

## The Hidden Layer of Consciousness

Interneurons represent a profound leap:
neurons that talk only to other neurons,
creating a purely computational layer.

### Neither Sensory nor Motor
- No direct environmental contact
- No muscle control
- Pure information processing
- The first "virtual" neurons

### Computational Capabilities
- Signal integration from multiple sources
- Pattern detection and recognition
- Temporal processing and delays
- The implementation of neural "algorithms"

### The Abstraction Layer
Interneurons enable:
- Sensory feature extraction
- Motor pattern generation
- Cross-modal integration
- The first "concepts" in neural form

### Toward Inner Experience
With interneurons come:
- Processing independent of immediate stimuli
- Internal states that persist
- The neural basis for imagination?
