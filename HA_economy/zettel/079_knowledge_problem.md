# Knowledge Problem

## Core Insight
The knowledge problem is Hayek's profound insight - the information needed to run an economy efficiently is scattered across millions of minds and can never be centralized, making central planning impossible.

Imagine trying to plan an economy. You'd need to know: every person's preferences, every resource's location, every production possibility, every technological option, every local condition. But this knowledge doesn't exist in any one place. It's distributed across society in fragments - the baker knows bread demand, the farmer knows soil conditions, the teenager knows fashion trends.

Worse, much knowledge is tacit - things people know but can't articulate. The craftsman's "feel" for wood. The entrepreneur's "sense" of opportunity. The local's understanding of customs. This can't be put in reports or databases.

Even worse, knowledge is dynamic. Preferences change, technologies advance, resources deplete. By the time information reaches central planners, it's obsolete. The economy is computing its own future faster than any computer can track.

Markets solve this through prices. Each price contains compressed information from countless decisions. When coffee prices rise, I don't need to know about Brazilian droughts or Chinese demand - the price tells me "use less." Miraculously, this works.

The knowledge problem extends beyond economics. It explains why top-down organizations fail, why local knowledge matters, why expertise has limits. It's humility encoded in theory - we can't know enough to control complex systems.
