# Market Dynamics

## Core Insight
Markets are collective intelligence systems where millions of independent decisions create emergent price signals, allocating resources without central planning.

Supply meets demand at price. Simple concept, profound reality. Markets process vast information: costs, desires, alternatives, futures. No computer could calculate what markets compute naturally through distributed decision-making.

The dynamics run deep. High prices signal "make more," attracting producers. Low prices signal "make less," redirecting resources. Competition drives efficiency. Innovation disrupts equilibrium. Creative destruction renews constantly.

But markets aren't perfect. They have biases, bubbles, blindness. They optimize for exchange value, not human value. They're amazing at allocation, terrible at distribution. Understanding market dynamics means seeing both power and limitations.
