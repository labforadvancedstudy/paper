# Types of Infinity and Cardinal Arithmetic

## Core Insight
Infinity comes in sizes - there's not just one infinity but an infinite hierarchy of infinities.

## Content
Cantor's great discovery: we can compare infinite sizes. Two sets have the same size if we can pair their elements perfectly. This works even for infinite sets.

The infinite cardinals:
- ℵ₀ (aleph-null): size of natural numbers
- 2^ℵ₀: size of real numbers (continuum)
- ℵ₁: next infinity after ℵ₀
- And so on forever...

Shocking results:
- Rational numbers: same size as naturals (ℵ₀)
- Algebraic numbers: still ℵ₀
- Transcendental numbers: size of continuum
- Almost all real numbers are transcendental!

Cardinal arithmetic is weird:
- ℵ₀ + ℵ₀ = ℵ₀
- ℵ₀ × ℵ₀ = ℵ₀
- 2^ℵ₀ > ℵ₀ (always!)
- ℵ₀^ℵ₀ = 2^ℵ₀

The Continuum Hypothesis asks: is there an infinity between ℵ₀ and 2^ℵ₀? Gödel and Cohen proved: the question is undecidable in ZFC!

Large cardinals go beyond:
- Inaccessible cardinals
- Measurable cardinals
- Woodin cardinals
- Each assumption adds consistency strength

Infinity isn't one thing - it's an entire universe of different sizes, each unreachable from below.
