# Participatory Art

## Core Insight
Audience becomes artist - where completion requires viewer action, transforming passive consumption into active creation, democratizing the artistic process.

Participatory art refuses the divide. No longer artist-makes/audience-receives but collaborative creation:
- Instructions for action (Fluxus scores)
- Social situations as medium (Tiravanija's meals)
- Collective building (Burning Man)
- Online collaborations (Reddit Place)
- Relational aesthetics (human interaction art)

Participation levels vary:
- Nominal: pressing button, walking path
- Directed: following specific instructions
- Creative: adding personal expression
- Collaborative: equal co-creation
- Community: long-term engagement

Power questions arise:
- Who controls framework?
- What choices actually available?
- Does participation equal agency?
- Exploitation vs. empowerment?
- Documentation ownership?

Historical roots deep:
- Religious rituals
- Folk art traditions
- Carnival inversions
- Happenings 1960s
- Social practice 1990s

Digital enables mass participation:
- Crowdsourced artworks
- AR filter creation
- Meme evolution
- Game modifications
- Blockchain collaborations

But problems emerge:
- Quality control absent
- Authorship confused
- Institutions struggle
- Markets resist
- Critics confounded

Yet public hungers for participation. Museum selfies, immersive experiences, maker spaces. Passive viewing feels incomplete. Netflix choose-your-adventure. Everyone wants to touch, change, contribute.
