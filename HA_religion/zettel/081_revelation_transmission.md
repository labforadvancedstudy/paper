# Revelation as Transmission

## Core Insight
Divine communication as information transfer across dimensional barriers - the cosmos downloading meaning into human consciousness.

If religion is true, revelation is the fundamental puzzle: how does infinite communicate with finite? It's essentially an information theory problem. The bandwidth mismatch is absolute - God:Human :: Ocean:Teacup.

Transmission challenges:
- **Encoding** - infinite meaning into finite symbols
- **Channel** - what medium carries divine data?
- **Noise** - cultural static, psychological interference
- **Decoding** - human limitations in reception
- **Error checking** - how verify accurate transmission?

Religious solutions to the bandwidth problem:
- **Progressive revelation** - bit by bit across history
- **Multiple channels** - prophets, nature, conscience, scripture
- **Redundancy** - same message many ways
- **Community verification** - collective error-correction
- **Tradition** - preserving signal across time

The deeper pattern: revelation might not be supernatural interruption but natural function. Just as DNA transmits biological information across generations, perhaps consciousness has channels for meaning-transmission we don't yet understand.

Modern twist: if universe is computational, revelation is software update. Prophets are ports. Mystics achieve direct connection. Prayer is attempting handshake with cosmic OS. Sacred texts are compressed downloads requiring interpretation engine.

Or it's all noise, no signal. Pattern-seeking minds finding patterns in static. The tragedy/comedy of taking cosmic dial tone for divine communication.
