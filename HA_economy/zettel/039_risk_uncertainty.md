# Risk and Uncertainty

## Core Insight
The known unknowns and unknown unknowns: risk can be priced, uncertainty can't - economics at the edge of knowledge.

Risk is rolling dice - you don't know the outcome but know the odds. Uncertainty is not knowing if you're playing dice, cards, or Russian roulette. Markets handle risk well, uncertainty poorly.

Distinctions matter:
- **Risk** - known probability distribution
- **Uncertainty** - unknown probabilities  
- **Ambiguity** - unknown outcomes possible
- **Black swans** - inconceivable becomes real
- **Tail risks** - rare but catastrophic

How we handle unknowns:
- Insurance (pooling risk)
- Diversification (spreading bets)
- Options (paying for flexibility)
- Reserves (buffer against surprise)
- Antifragility (gaining from disorder)

The deep challenge: most of life is uncertainty, not risk. We pretend otherwise, building models assuming normal distributions in a wild world.

Financial crises occur when uncertainty gets mispriced as risk. "Once in a century" events happen every decade. The models assume dice; reality plays Calvinball.
