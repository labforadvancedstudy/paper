## Abstract

We propose that effective communication in human systems requires participants to operate within one hierarchical abstraction level of each other. This "±1 Rule" explains patterns in relationships, organizations, and international relations.

## Core Principle

Humans operate at different abstraction levels (L1-L9):
- L1-L2: Concrete/Operational
- L3-L4: Tactical/Design  
- L5-L6: Strategic/Architectural
- L7-L8: Philosophical/Universal
- L9: Meta-Universal

**The ±1 Rule**: Effective communication occurs only between adjacent levels.

## Evidence

### Personal Relationships
- L5 + L3 partner = communication breakdown
- L5 + L5 partner = natural understanding
- L5 + L4/L6 partner = workable with effort

### Organizational Dynamics
- CEO(L5) → Manager(L4) → Staff(L3) = Success
- CEO(L5) → Staff(L3) direct = Failure

### International Relations
- USA(L7) allied with UK(L7) = Stable
- USA(L7) vs Iraq(L3) = No dialogue possible
- China(L6) challenging USA(L7) = Competition (1 level gap)

## Implications

1. **Conflict Source**: Most conflicts arise from attempting communication across >1 level gaps
2. **Mediation Need**: Intermediate levels required for distant level communication
3. **Natural Alliances**: Same-level entities naturally cooperate

## Conclusion

The ±1 Rule appears to be a fundamental constraint on human communication systems. Understanding and respecting abstraction levels could prevent conflicts and improve cooperation.
