# Symbol

## Core Insight
Symbols are material objects that participate in the spiritual reality they represent - not mere signs but living connections.

A cross isn't just wood arranged perpendicularly. Water isn't just H2O in baptism. Bread isn't just baked wheat in communion. These physical things become vessels for meaning that exceeds their material nature. Symbols work because humans are meaning-making creatures who need concrete forms for abstract realities.

Symbol characteristics:
- Participates in what it symbolizes
- Carries multiple meanings simultaneously
- Evokes more than explains
- Transforms through engagement
- Creates what it represents

Universal religious symbols:
- Circle: wholeness, eternity, divine perfection
- Tree/Cross: axis between earth and heaven
- Light/Fire: divine presence, transformation
- Water: cleansing, death/rebirth, life
- Mountain: ascent, meeting place with divine

Symbols aren't arbitrary. They emerge from deep psyche patterns, cultural repetitions, archetypal experiences. The cross works because humans understand intersection. Water cleanses because we've all been washed. Fire transforms because we've seen it consume and renew.

The symbol paradox: It's "just" material yet carries infinite meaning. Destroy the symbol and meaning persists. Yet without symbols, meaning has no home in material world.

Symbols are the language of the between.
