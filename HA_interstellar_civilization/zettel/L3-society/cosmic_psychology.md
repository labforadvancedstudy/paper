# Cosmic Psychology

## Core Insight
The human mind evolved for African savannas, not the void between stars - interstellar civilization must engineer new psychologies or watch its pioneers go mad from scales beyond comprehension.

The psychological challenges compound:
- **Cosmic insignificance**: You're a mote between infinite dark
- **Temporal displacement**: Everyone you knew is dead
- **Spatial disorientation**: No up, down, or home
- **Existential isolation**: Help is decades away
- **Purpose drift**: Why are we doing this again?
- **Reality dissociation**: Is any of this real?

Earth psychology assumes:
- Day/night cycles (gone in space)
- Seasonal changes (artificial at best)
- Horizon lines (none in void)
- Escape options (nowhere to run)
- Social variety (same faces forever)
- Generational continuity (broken by time dilation)

New psychological adaptations needed:
- **Void comfort**: Finding peace in emptiness
- **Deep time thinking**: Comfort with geological scales
- **Collective identity**: Individual ego subordination
- **Purpose inheritance**: Accepting ancestors' dreams
- **Synthetic nature**: Finding beauty in artificial
- **Mortality acceptance**: Death far from Earth

The risk: Human minds might simply break when truly comprehending interstellar reality. The distances, the time, the isolation - evolution didn't prepare us for this.

Engineering spaceships is easy compared to engineering minds that can handle riding them.
