# Reality Consensus

## Core Insight
Reality isn't discovered but negotiated - civilization is the ongoing argument about what's real.

A schizophrenic sees demons. You don't. Who's right? Society votes: you win, they're medicated. But in medieval times, demon-seers were prophets. Reality isn't fixed - it's what most people agree on.

This sounds insane until you examine "normal" reality. Money? Consensual hallucination. Countries? Imaginary lines. Laws? Shared fiction. Most of civilization exists only in the intersection of believing minds.

The deepest level of civilization isn't technology or institutions - it's the shared agreement about what exists. When that consensus breaks, civilizations collapse. Not from invasions or disasters, but from people stopping to believe the same reality.
