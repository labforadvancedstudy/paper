# Balance

## Core Insight
Visual weight distributed across composition - not physics but psychology, where small dark shapes can balance large light ones through the mind's strange mathematics.

Balance isn't weighing objects. It's weighing attention. Factors creating visual weight:
- Size (larger = heavier)
- Value (darker = heavier)
- Color (warm/saturated = heavier)
- Position (edge = heavier than center)
- Isolation (alone = heavier)
- Complexity (detailed = heavier)
- Direction (pointing = heavier)

Types of balance:
- Symmetrical: mirror-like, formal, stable
- Asymmetrical: unequal but equilibrium
- Radial: center-point distribution
- Crystallographic: all-over pattern

Asymmetrical balance creates more interest. Large empty space balances small complex object. Light area balances dark. Mind finds equilibrium through compensation, not matching.

Cultural weight affects balance. Face heavier than abstract shape. Text heavier than texture. Recognized objects carry meaning-weight beyond visual weight.

Imbalance serves purpose too:
- Creates tension
- Implies movement
- Suggests instability
- Generates energy
- Leads eye

Digital tools offer balance analysis - grids, guides, mathematical centers. But balance lives in perception, not measurement. What measures as balanced may feel wrong. Trust eye over ruler.

Masters played with balance. Degas's off-center dancers. Cassatt's edge-cropped figures. They knew: perfect balance is death. Life tilts.
