# Financial Markets

## Core Insight
Financial markets are humanity's time machine - moving resources from those who have to those who need, from now to later, from certain to uncertain futures.

At the surface, financial markets look like chaos - numbers flashing, traders yelling, charts zigzagging. But underneath is something profound: the collective intelligence of millions trying to figure out what everything is worth.

When you buy a stock, you're not just buying paper. You're buying a claim on future profits. When you buy a bond, you're lending money through time. When you trade currencies, you're betting on the relative strength of entire economies. Every trade is a vote about the future.

The magic is in the aggregation. No single person knows what Apple should be worth, or where interest rates should be. But millions of people making bets with real money create prices that encode vast amounts of information. A stock price contains knowledge about technology trends, consumer preferences, regulatory risks, and thousands of other factors.

Financial markets are also amplifiers. They can turn optimism into bubbles and fear into crashes. They're mirrors of human psychology at scale - greed, fear, hope, and panic all made visible in price movements. They're where the abstract meets the real, where beliefs about the future create the present.
