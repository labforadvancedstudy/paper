# City Emergence

## Core Insight
Cities are humanity's attempt to build beehives - dense nodes where strangers become a superorganism.

A village is everyone knowing everyone. A city is most people being strangers. This shouldn't work. In nature, stranger = danger. But cities invented a miracle: functional anonymity.

In cities, you don't need to know the baker to buy bread. Systems replace relationships. Laws replace customs. Money replaces favors. The city runs on rules, not relationships.

Cities concentrate everything: people, ideas, diseases, wealth, garbage. This density creates emergent properties. Innovation explodes when ideas can randomly collide. Art flourishes when artists can find audiences. But so do plagues, crime, inequality. Cities amplify everything - good and bad.
