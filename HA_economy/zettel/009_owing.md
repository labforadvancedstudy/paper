# Owing

## Core Insight
The weight of debt: when "I'll pay you back" creates an invisible chain between souls.

A child borrowing lunch money discovers owing - the economic relationship that transcends the moment. Debt is promise made material, future obligation born from present need.

Owing creates:
- **Obligation** - I must remember and repay
- **Trust bonds** - lending requires faith
- **Time pressure** - debt clock ticks
- **Social weight** - owing changes relationships
- **Power dynamics** - debtor serves creditor

The owing child feels:
- Gratitude mixed with burden
- The itch to be debt-free
- Shame if unable to repay
- Relief when debt cleared
- Caution about future borrowing

This scales to everything:
- Credit cards are institutionalized owing
- Mortgages are three-decade owings
- National debt is collective owing
- Favors are social owing

The profound truth: owing creates relationship. Debt isn't just economic - it's interpersonal. The borrowed dollar creates connection until repaid. Economy runs on a web of mutual obligations.

"Neither borrower nor lender be" - because owing changes everything.
