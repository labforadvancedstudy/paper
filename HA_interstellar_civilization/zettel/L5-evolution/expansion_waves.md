# Expansion Waves

## Core Insight
Interstellar expansion doesn't happen smoothly - it pulses outward in waves as technology improves, with each wave potentially overtaking the previous one, creating a complex archaeology of settlement.

The pattern is counterintuitive: First wave colonists traveling at 1% light speed might arrive to find their destination already colonized by third wave colonists who left centuries later at 10% light speed.

Wave dynamics:
- **Wave 1**: Desperate/idealistic pioneers, slow ships
- **Wave 2**: Better technology, catching up
- **Wave 3**: Advanced propulsion, overtaking
- **Wave 4**: Maybe FTL, rewriting everything

Each wave creates different outcomes:
- Early waves: Hardy pioneers, adapted to hardship
- Middle waves: Established tech, balanced settlement
- Late waves: High tech but maybe soft
- Overtaking waves: Conflict with earlier settlers

The "Overtaking Problem":
- You spend 500 years getting there
- Someone else arrives in 50
- Who owns the planet?
- Do technologies even compatible?
- Cultural conflicts across centuries

This creates stratified colonization:
- Archaeological layers of settlement
- Technology mismatches
- Legal nightmares
- Cultural time capsules
- Potential warfare across eras

Expansion waves mean the frontier is never simple - it's a complex interference pattern of different human eras meeting in space.
