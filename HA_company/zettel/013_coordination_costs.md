# Coordination Costs

## Core Insight
Coordination costs are the hidden tax on organizational complexity - the exponentially growing price of keeping divided labor synchronized and aligned.

Two people need one conversation. Ten people need forty-five. A hundred need 4,950. This isn't inefficiency - it's mathematics. Every additional person adds n-1 new relationships to manage. Coordination complexity grows as n².

These costs manifest everywhere: meetings multiply, emails explode, decisions slow, misalignments emerge. The larger the organization, the more energy spent on internal coordination versus external value creation. Eventually, coordination consumes everything.

Organizations fight this through structure: hierarchy reduces connections, process standardizes interactions, culture aligns without communication. But you can't eliminate coordination costs, only manage them. The price of scale is complexity.
