# Photography

## Core Insight
Light writing itself - the mechanical eye that democratized image-making while sparking endless debates about truth, authorship, and the nature of the real.

Photography's paradox: most objective art (light and chemistry) yet deeply subjective (framing, moment, development). Every photograph lies by excluding everything outside frame, freezing motion, flattening depth.

Technical choices shape meaning:
- Aperture: what's sharp, what's blur
- Shutter speed: time compressed or extended
- Focal length: intimate or distant
- Film/sensor: grain, color, sensitivity
- Development/processing: reality's interpretation

Digital revolutionized and complicated:
- Instant feedback changes seeing
- Infinite shots reduce decisiveness
- Post-processing questions "truth"
- Distribution immediate, global
- Storage ephemeral despite plenty

Photography's genres evolved into languages:
- Documentary: witness, evidence, social change
- Portrait: psychology through surface
- Landscape: nature as idea, not place
- Street: decisive moment hunting
- Conceptual: idea over image
- Abstract: camera as brush

"Everyone's a photographer now." Billions of images daily. Yet serious photography persists. Why? Because seeing isn't photographing. The frame creates meaning. Selection from chaos. Point of view literally.

Contemporary photography questions itself:
- AI generates "photographs" without cameras
- Deepfakes erode documentary trust
- Instagram aesthetics homogenize vision
- Film resurgence as resistance
- NFTs monetize digital uniqueness
