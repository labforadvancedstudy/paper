# Black Hole Detection

## Core Insight
We detect invisible objects by their visible effects - black holes reveal themselves through doomed matter's dying screams of X-rays and the orbital dances of companion stars.

Black holes emit no light by definition, yet we've found thousands. The key is indirect detection. In binary systems, we see stars orbiting invisible massive companions. Applying Kepler's laws reveals masses exceeding the neutron star limit (~3 solar masses) - black holes by elimination. Cygnus X-1, the first confirmed black hole, betrays itself through X-rays from superheated gas spiraling inward from its companion star.

Supermassive black holes in galaxy centers reveal themselves through star orbits. Andrea Ghez and Reinhard Genzel tracked stars zipping around Sagittarius A* at thousands of kilometers per second, proving a 4-million-solar-mass black hole lurks there. Active galactic nuclei shine from accretion disk radiation. Gravitational waves from merging black holes provide direct confirmation. The Event Horizon Telescope imaged black hole shadows - absence of light outlining the point of no return. We map the invisible through its consequences.
