# Foreign Exchange (Forex)

## Core Insight
Forex is the market where money itself is the commodity - a 24/7 global casino where currencies battle for supremacy and every exchange rate is a judgment on entire civilizations.

In forex, money loses its mask and reveals itself as pure relationship. A dollar isn't worth anything alone - it only has value relative to euros, yen, yuan. Every exchange rate is a compressed opinion about two countries' futures. When USD/EUR moves, it's not numbers changing - it's the market's collective bet on American versus European prosperity.

The mind-bending scale:
- $7.5 trillion traded daily (more than most countries' GDP)
- 24/5 market that follows the sun
- Leverage up to 100:1 (control $100 with $1)
- Currencies as weapons (sanctions, manipulation)
- Central banks as whales among minnows

Forex proves money's deepest truth: value is always relative, never absolute. There's no "true" price for a dollar - only what someone will trade for it right now. Every rate is a mirror reflecting two economies, every trade a vote on the future.
