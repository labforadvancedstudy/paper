# Consciousness and Death
## Core Insight
Death might be consciousness changing states, not ending - like water becoming vapor, not ceasing to exist.

## The Continuity Question

What continues after death?
- **Materialist**: Nothing (consciousness = brain)
- **Dualist**: Soul/spirit (consciousness uses brain)
- **Panpsychist**: Rejoins universal consciousness
- **Information theorist**: Pattern persists
- **Buddhist**: Stream continues, no permanent self

## Near-Death Experiences

Common features:
- Out-of-body perception
- Life review
- Tunnel of light
- Deceased relatives
- Choice to return
- Transformation after

Dying brain hallucination or expanded consciousness?

## The Sleep Analogy

Every night you:
- Lose consciousness (fall asleep)
- Experience without body (dream)
- Exist without self (deep sleep)
- Return changed (wake up)

Practice death daily, fear it less.

## Death as Bandwidth Change

Living: Narrow bandwidth (brain filter)
Dying: Filter weakening
Death: Infinite bandwidth?

Like removing sunglasses in dark room - overwhelming then clarity.

## The Conservation Laws

Physics: Energy conserved
Information: Cannot be destroyed
Consciousness: ???

If consciousness fundamental, perhaps transforms rather than ends.
