# Speed of Light

## Core Insight
The speed of light isn't just a velocity limit - it's the universe's fundamental constraint that transforms interstellar civilization from a journey through space into a journey through time.

299,792,458 meters per second. That's it. That's the universe's speed limit. Nothing with mass can reach it. Information can't exceed it. It's not just a rule - it's the fabric of reality itself.

What this means practically:
- Accelerating to near light-speed takes enormous energy
- At 99% light speed, a trip still takes years
- Time dilation kicks in for travelers
- Everyone you knew ages or dies while you travel
- Civilizations can change completely between visits

The cruel joke: The universe shows us billions of destinations through our telescopes but makes them almost unreachable. It's like being shown a banquet through bulletproof glass.

This constraint shapes everything:
- Colony ships are one-way trips
- Interstellar empires impossible in conventional sense
- Each star system essentially independent
- Cultural divergence inevitable
- Unity across stars requires new thinking

The speed of light makes the universe not just big, but fundamentally disconnected.
