# Composition

## Core Insight
The invisible architecture of images - how elements relate in space to create unity, movement, and meaning beyond individual parts.

Composition is relationship. Single element has no composition. Two elements create:
- Distance (near/far)
- Direction (toward/away)
- Hierarchy (dominant/subordinate)
- Tension (balanced/unbalanced)

Add more elements, relationships multiply exponentially. Artist's job: orchestrate chaos into order (or meaningful disorder).

Classic compositional structures:
- Rule of thirds (off-center interest)
- Golden ratio (natural proportion)
- Symmetry (formal balance)
- Asymmetry (dynamic balance)
- Radial (center-focused)
- Grid (modular order)

But rules mislead. Great compositions often break conventions. They feel right through:
- Visual flow (eye path)
- Weight distribution (not literal)
- Focal points (rest areas)
- Unity with variety
- Purposeful imbalance

Eye reads composition instantly, before recognizing subjects. This pre-cognitive response determines whether viewer stays or leaves. Composition is visual grammar - wrong syntax creates confusion, even if words are perfect.

Digital tools made composition both easier and harder. Grids, guides, infinite adjustment. But infinite options paralyze. Constraints of physical media forced decisions that digital endlessly defers.

Abstract art revealed composition's power. Without recognizable subjects, only relationships remain. Mondrian's rectangles. Pollock's all-over energy. Pure composition speaking.
