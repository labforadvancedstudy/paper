# Shape

## Core Insight
When a line meets itself or boundaries contain space, shape emerges - the fundamental unit of visual recognition and the building block of all representation.

A line wanders and returns home: circle. Lines meet at angles: triangle. Four meetings: square. These aren't just geometry - they're psychological primitives. Circle = wholeness, safety, continuity. Triangle = direction, stability, danger. Square = order, human-made, containment.

Shapes carry meaning before culture assigns it:
- Organic shapes (flowing, irregular): nature, life, comfort
- Geometric shapes (precise, regular): mind, control, artificial
- Angular shapes (sharp points): aggression, energy, warning
- Curved shapes (smooth flows): gentleness, movement, femininity
- Open shapes (incomplete boundaries): possibility, freedom
- Closed shapes (complete boundaries): definition, limitation

Children draw shapes before objects. Circle with radiating lines = sun. Square with triangle = house. They understand: shape is essence. Details are decoration.

Artists manipulate shape psychology. Mondrian's rectangles create calm through order. Kandinsky's triangles generate dynamism. O'Keeffe's organic curves suggest without depicting. Shape speaks directly to the part of brain that sorts safe from dangerous, friend from foe.

Negative shapes (spaces between) equal positive shapes in power. The arrow hidden in FedEx. The faces in vase. Shape includes what isn't there.

Every complex image reduces to simple shapes. Squint at any painting - shapes emerge as structure bones.
