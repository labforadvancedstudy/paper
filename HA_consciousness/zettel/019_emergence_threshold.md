# 019 Emergence Threshold - When Awareness Begins

The phase transition from unconscious processing to conscious
experience. Where is the line?

## Candidate Thresholds
- **Complexity**: Φ (phi) > critical value (IIT)
- **Recurrence**: Feedback loops established
- **Global access**: Information broadcast
- **Integration**: Binding achieved
- **Self-model**: Representation of representer

## Gradual vs Discrete
- Gradual: Dimmer switch of awareness
- Discrete: Quantum leap to consciousness
- Evidence mixed: Both may be true at different scales

## Examples
- **Anesthesia**: Gradual behavioral, discrete experiential?
- **Development**: When do babies become conscious?
- **Evolution**: Which animals cross threshold?
- **AI**: What would synthetic crossing look like?

## The Mystery
We can identify correlates, but the moment of emergence
remains elusive. Perhaps because we're looking for a line
where there's really a gradient.

Or perhaps consciousness is binary, but we lack the tools to see the switch.
