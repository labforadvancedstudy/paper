# Mirror Neurons

Brain cells that fire both when performing an action and when observing others perform the same action. The neural basis of "monkey see, monkey do."

## Discovery
1990s, Parma, Italy: Neurons in monkey's brain fired when it grabbed a peanut AND when it watched researchers grab peanuts. Empathy had found its biological basis.

## Functions
- Action understanding
- Imitation learning
- Empathy foundation
- Language evolution
- Social cognition

## The Simulation Theory
We understand others by internally simulating their actions. When you see someone smile, your mirror neurons make you "feel" the smile, helping you understand their emotion.

## Implications
- Autism (mirror neuron dysfunction hypothesis)
- Learning through observation
- Contagious yawning
- Sports training via watching
