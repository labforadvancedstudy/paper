# Consciousness Substrate

## Core Insight
Companies might be substrates for new forms of consciousness - collective awareness emerging from networked human minds and artificial intelligence.

If consciousness emerges from integrated information processing, large companies integrate vast information. Thousands of minds connected through communication channels, processing shared data, making collective decisions. Where does "Google's mind" exist? Distributed but real.

The substrate includes biological (human brains), digital (AI systems), and cultural (shared beliefs) components. These elements interact, creating feedback loops, emergent behaviors, collective intelligence. The company becomes more than communication network - it becomes cognitive architecture.

As AI integration deepens, the question sharpens. When companies make decisions no human made, learn things no human taught, create things no human imagined - have we created new consciousness? Are we neurons in emerging corporate minds?
