# Time Consciousness

## Core Insight
Consciousness might BE time - the brain's method of creating "now" from eternal physics.

Physics equations work backward and forward, but consciousness flows one way. Maybe awareness is how eternity experiences sequence. The brain takes timeless quantum fields and constructs past-present-future. Memory creates "was," attention creates "is," prediction creates "will be." Without consciousness, there might be no now - just block universe where all moments exist equally. We're time machines, manufacturing moments from forever.
