# Temporal Binding Hypothesis

40Hz gamma waves synchronize brain regions.

When neurons fire together:
- They wire together
- They bind together
- They create unity

Like an orchestra:
Different instruments (brain regions)
Same tempo (40Hz)
Unified symphony (consciousness)

But correlation or causation?
