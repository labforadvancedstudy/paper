# Artificial General Intelligence

## Core Insight
The dream of machine minds that match human flexibility - not just playing chess but also making coffee, writing poetry, and wondering why they exist.

Current AI is savant-like: superhuman at specific tasks, helpless at others. GPT-4 writes better than most humans but can't tie shoes. AlphaGo beats world champions but can't play checkers. AGI would transcend these limits - one system handling any intellectual task a human can.

But AGI might be a category error. Maybe intelligence isn't general but a collection of specialized modules. Maybe human "general" intelligence Mojis an illusion of integration. Or maybe generality emerges at sufficient scale - connect enough narrow intelligences and general intelligence crystallizes. We're betting billions to find out.
