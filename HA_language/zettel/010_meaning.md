# Meaning

## Core Insight
The bridge between symbol and reality - how arbitrary sounds point to the world.

## The Central Mystery

How does "dog" mean dog? Not resemblance - the word doesn't bark. Not natural connection - different languages use different sounds. Meaning is the agreed-upon illusion that makes communication possible.

Types of meaning:
- **Referential**: Points to things in world
- **Sense**: The concept, not the thing
- **Emotive**: The feeling conveyed
- **Social**: What it says about relationships
- **Pragmatic**: What it does in context

Meaning is slippery:
- "Bank" (river? money?)
- "He's hot" (temperature? attractive?)
- "Can you pass the salt?" (ability? request?)
