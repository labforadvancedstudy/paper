# Dissipative Structures

## Core Insight
Order that exists only while energy flows through it - life as a whirlpool in the stream of entropy.

A whirlpool is the perfect metaphor: it has structure, boundaries, behavior. But stop the water flow and it vanishes instantly. It exists only as long as energy (flowing water) passes through it. Life is the same - structured only while energy flows through.

Ilya Prigogine won the Nobel Prize for showing that systems far from equilibrium can spontaneously create order by dissipating energy faster. A Bernard cell (heated fluid forming hexagonal patterns) increases entropy more efficiently than random convection. Life might be the universe's most sophisticated entropy accelerator.

Your body maintains its impossible order by constantly exporting entropy. You take in low-entropy energy (food), use some for work, and export high-entropy waste and heat. Stop this flow for minutes and the order collapses irreversibly.

This explains life's origin puzzle: order doesn't violate thermodynamics if it increases universal disorder faster. Life exists not despite the second law but because of it. We are entropy's agents, helping the universe die more efficiently.
