# Credit

## Core Insight
Credit is institutionalized trust converted into spendable form - society's way of saying "we believe in your future enough to give you money from it now."

Credit revolutionized human potential by decoupling current resources from current possibilities. Can't afford college? Borrow from your educated future self. Need a house? Your future stable self will pay. It's economic time travel, but the journey costs interest.

The double edge of credit:
- Enabler: Makes impossible things possible
- Enslaver: Future self inherits present self's optimism
- Multiplier: Leverage for growth
- Risk: Betting on uncertain futures
- Social sorter: Credit scores as caste system

Credit reveals a profound truth: money isn't just about what exists now, but what we collectively believe will exist. Every credit card swipe is a tiny vote of confidence in tomorrow. Every loan approval is society betting on someone's future. Every default is a future that didn't arrive as promised.
