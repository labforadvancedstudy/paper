# Telling Stories

## Core Insight
Stories are humanity's original virtual reality - creating shared worlds that exist only in networked minds.

Every animal communicates: "danger!" "food!" "mate with me!" But only humans say "let me tell you about something that never happened to people who never existed." And everyone leans in to listen.

Stories do something impossible: they let us experience things we've never lived. Through stories, we can die a thousand deaths and learn from each one. We can be heroes, villains, gods. We can travel to places that don't exist.

But the real magic? Stories synchronize brains. When a storyteller speaks, listener brains literally sync up. Same neural patterns. Same emotions. Same imagined reality. Stories turn separate minds into one distributed consciousness.
