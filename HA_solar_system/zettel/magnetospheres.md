# Magnetospheres

## Core Insight
Invisible magnetic bubbles surround some planets - force fields that deflect solar wind and create auroral light shows, separating protected worlds from exposed ones.

Earth's magnetosphere is our invisible shield. Generated by molten iron churning in the core, it extends far into space, deflecting charged particles that would strip our atmosphere. The solar wind compresses it on the sunward side, stretches it into a long tail behind. Where solar particles sneak through at the poles, they paint the sky with aurora - nature's neon signs.

Not all planets are so protected. Mars lost its magnetosphere billions of years ago, and with it, most of its atmosphere. Venus has only a weak induced field. But Jupiter's magnetosphere is monstrous - if visible, it would appear larger than the full Moon in Earth's sky. These magnetic bubbles determine habitability as much as distance from the Sun. In the battle between stellar wind and planetary magnetism, life hangs in the balance.
