# Protocol Design

## Core Insight
Protocols are agreements made code - the social contracts of systems that enable strangers to cooperate without understanding, creating order from potential chaos.

A protocol is a shared hallucination of procedure. TCP/IP doesn't exist in any wire or chip - it exists in the agreement to pretend packets have headers, sequences, acknowledgments. The protocol is the dance everyone agrees to dance.

Good protocols are invisible. HTTP vanishes behind browsing. SMTP disappears into "send." They work because they define boundaries: you handle this, I'll handle that, and we'll meet at this interface. Protocols create interoperability without interdependence.

From handshakes to internet standards: protocols enable complexity. They're the APIs of interaction, the interfaces of agreement. Design the protocol, design the possible. Every protocol is a constitution for a tiny technical democracy.
