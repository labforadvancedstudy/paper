# Hunger

## Core Insight
The body's non-negotiable demand for fuel - evolution's whip that ensures you can't forget to eat.

Hunger starts as a whisper: empty stomach, slight distraction. But ignore it, and it becomes a tyrant. Your thoughts bend toward food. Your nose becomes hypersensitive to cooking smells. Your mouth waters at the mere mention of eating.

True hunger - not "I skipped lunch" but "I haven't eaten in days" - reveals how thin the line is between civilized human and desperate animal. People have sold everything, betrayed everyone, even eaten the unthinkable when truly hungry. It strips away culture, leaving only biology.

The mechanism is elegant: blood sugar drops, stomach empty, ghrelin hormone rises. Your hypothalamus sounds the alarm. But it's not just physical - it's deeply emotional. Hunger makes you irritable, anxious, unable to focus. "Hangry" is real brain chemistry.

Yet we can override it temporarily. Fasting, dieting, anorexia - human will can suppress hunger. But not forever. Eventually, biology wins. The drive to eat is older than consciousness, stronger than willpower.
