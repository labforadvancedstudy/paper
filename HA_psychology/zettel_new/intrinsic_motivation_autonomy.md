# Intrinsic Motivation: Autonomy Drive

**Core Concept**: We're most motivated when we choose our actions, not when forced or bribed.

## One-Line Definition
The joy of doing something for its own sake dies when external rewards take over.

## Simple Mental Model
Like a child who loves drawing until they're paid for it - suddenly it becomes "work" and loses its magic.

## Key Mechanism
1. Internal locus of causality
2. Sense of choice and volition
3. Activity becomes self-expression
4. Reward is the doing itself

## Practical Example
A programmer coding for fun on weekends, losing track of time. Same activity at work with deadlines and requirements feels like drudgery. The code is identical; the motivation transformed.

## Common Misconception
Adding rewards always increases motivation. Actually, external rewards can crowd out intrinsic motivation - pay kids to read and they stop reading for pleasure.
