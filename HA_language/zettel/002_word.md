# Word

## Core Insight
The atom of meaning - smallest unit that can stand alone and mean something.

## The Building Block

Words are miracles. Sound patterns (phonemes) combine into meaning units (morphemes) that point to reality. Every language cuts up reality differently:

English: "snow"
Inuit: Dozens of words for different snow types
Korean: Different words for cooked/uncooked rice (밥/쌀)

L1: Names for things (concrete nouns)
L2: Names for actions (verbs)
L3: Names for qualities (adjectives)
L4: Names for relations (prepositions)
L5: Names for names (pronouns)
L6: Names for functions (articles)
L9: Words creating reality

Word = sound + meaning + rules for combination
