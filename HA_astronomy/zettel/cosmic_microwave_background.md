# Cosmic Microwave Background

## Core Insight
The CMB is the universe's baby picture - light from when atoms first formed 380,000 years after the Big Bang, now stretched to microwaves, carrying information about everything that would become.

In 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson tried to eliminate noise from their radio antenna. The persistent hiss from every direction wasn't pigeons or equipment failure - it was the cooled afterglow of creation. The early universe was opaque, filled with free electrons scattering photons. As it cooled below 3000K, electrons combined with protons forming neutral hydrogen. Suddenly transparent, light traveled freely for the first time.

That ancient light, redshifted by a factor of 1100, arrives as 2.725K blackbody radiation. Tiny temperature fluctuations (parts per 100,000) reveal primordial density variations - seeds of all cosmic structure. The CMB's near-perfect uniformity confirms the Big Bang. Its tiny ripples explain why we exist - without them, gravity couldn't form galaxies. WMAP and Planck mapped these fluctuations precisely, revealing the universe's age, composition, and geometry. In microwave static, we read the cosmos's birth certificate.
