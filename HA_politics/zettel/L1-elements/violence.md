# Violence

## Core Insight
The destruction of bodies and things - politics' ultimate currency and constant shadow, the force that lurks behind all other forces.

Violence is power stripped to its essence: the ability to damage, destroy, end. It's the political ultima ratio - the final argument when all others fail.

But violence is never just physical. It radiates:
- The threat of violence (often more powerful than violence itself)
- Structural violence (poverty, oppression)
- Symbolic violence (humiliation, erasure)
- The memory of violence (trauma that shapes generations)

States claim a monopoly on legitimate violence. This is perhaps the core political arrangement: we give up our right to violence in exchange for protection from violence. But the state's violence remains violence.

The paradox: violence can destroy political order, but political order is often born from violence (revolutions, wars of independence) and maintained by its threat (law enforcement, military).\n\nViolence marks the boundary of politics. When words fail, violence speaks. But what violence says can never be unsaid - it changes everything it touches.\n\n## Connections
