# Data Visualization

## Core Insight
Making the invisible visible - where abstract numbers transform into sensory experience, revealing patterns hidden in complexity while creating new forms of beauty from information.

Visualization strategies:
- Mapping (data to visual)
- Scaling (proportion)
- Encoding (color/shape)
- Animation (time)
- Interaction (exploration)

Historical evolution:
- Scientific diagrams
- Statistical graphics
- Information design
- Data journalism
- Artistic visualization

Aesthetic decisions:
- Chart types
- Color palettes
- Layout systems
- Typography
- Motion design

Data as material:
- Climate measurements
- Social networks
- Economic flows
- Biological patterns
- Personal tracking

Artistic approaches:
- Poetic interpretation
- Critical visualization
- Speculative data
- Embodied statistics
- Ambient information

Challenges addressed:
- Complexity reduction
- Pattern revelation
- Narrative creation
- Emotional connection
- Action motivation

Ethical considerations:
- Data source
- Privacy protection
- Bias visualization
- Manipulation potential
- Access inequality

Tools proliferate:
- D3.js
- Processing
- Tableau
- Custom code
- AI assistance

Contemporary data art:
- Real-time feeds
- Participatory collection
- Physical manifestation
- Sonification parallel
- Live performance

Truth and beauty tension: Accurate ugly? Beautiful misleading? Best visualization balances. Data needs aesthetics to communicate. Beauty makes complexity accessible.
