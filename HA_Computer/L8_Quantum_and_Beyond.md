## The Classical Wall

We've pushed silicon to its limits. Transistors approaching atomic scale. Clock speeds plateaued. Moore's Law dying. Time for something completely different.

## Quantum Computing: Embracing Weirdness

Classical bits are decisive: 0 or 1. Qubits are quantum: 0 and 1 simultaneously.

**Superposition**: Be in multiple states at once
```
|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
```
Where α² + β² = 1. Not halfway between 0 and 1 - genuinely both until measured.

**Entanglement**: Spooky action at a distance
- Measure one qubit, instantly know about another
- No communication, just correlation
- Einstein hated it, but it's real

**Interference**: Cancel unwanted possibilities
- Quantum states can add or cancel
- Arrange computation so wrong answers cancel out
- Right answers reinforce

## The Quantum Circuit Model

No infinite loops in quantum computing - all circuits must be reversible.

**Quantum Gates**:
- **X Gate**: Quantum NOT, flips |0⟩ ↔ |1⟩
- **Hadamard**: Creates superposition
- **CNOT**: Entangles qubits
- **Phase Gates**: Rotate quantum states

Stack these carefully, and you can factor huge numbers, simulate molecules, break encryption.

## The Killer Apps

What are quantum computers actually good for?

**Shor's Algorithm**: Factor large numbers exponentially faster
- Classical: Exponential time
- Quantum: Polynomial time
- Breaks RSA encryption

**Grover's Algorithm**: Search unsorted databases
- Classical: O(n) - check each item
- Quantum: O(√n) - quadratic speedup

**Quantum Simulation**: Model quantum systems
- Drug discovery
- Material science
- High-temperature superconductors
- Actually useful!

## The Decoherence Problem

Quantum states are fragile. Any interaction with environment causes decoherence - superposition collapses to classical.

**Current Solutions**:
- Near absolute zero temperatures (millikelvins)
- Magnetic shielding
- Error correction (needs ~1000 physical qubits per logical qubit)
- Very short computation windows (microseconds)

Building a quantum computer is like performing surgery on soap bubbles during an earthquake.

## Quantum Supremacy/Advantage

2019: Google's Sycamore processor solves a problem in 200 seconds that would take classical computers 10,000 years.

Critics: "The problem is useless!"
Fans: "That's not the point!"

It proved quantum computers can do things classical computers practically cannot. The beginning of a new era.

## Biological Computing: Wet and Warm

Life computes. Can we harness it?

**DNA Computing**: 
- Store data in ATCG sequences
- Massive parallelism (trillions of molecules)
- Solved traveling salesman problem in test tube
- Slow but incredibly dense storage

**Protein Folding**: Nature's 3D printer
- Proteins compute their shape from sequence
- We're learning to design new proteins
- Custom enzymes, medicines, materials

**Neural Organoids**: Growing brains in dishes
- Real neurons forming networks
- Learning to play Pong
- Ethical nightmare fuel

## Neuromorphic Computing: Brain-Inspired Hardware

Instead of von Neumann architecture, copy the brain.

**Features**:
- Massive parallelism
- Event-driven (not clock-driven)
- Co-located memory and processing
- Adaptive connections

**Examples**:
- IBM TrueNorth: Million neurons on a chip
- Intel Loihi: Learning on the edge
- Human Brain Project: Simulate entire brain

Power efficiency is incredible - brains use ~20 watts, supercomputers use megawatts.

## Optical Computing: Thinking at Light Speed

Electrons are slow. Photons are fast. Why not compute with light?

**Advantages**:
- Speed of light
- No heat from resistance
- Massive parallelism (different wavelengths)
- Quantum effects at room temperature

**Challenges**:
- Photons don't interact easily
- Hard to store light
- Bulky components

Best for specific tasks like AI matrix multiplication, not general computing.

## Analog Computing: Everything Old is New

Digital threw away information for reliability. What if we kept it?

**Differential Analyzers**: Mechanical integration
**Analog Neural Networks**: Continuous values
**Memristors**: Analog memory devices
**Quantum Annealing**: Finding minimum energy states

Sometimes approximate answers NOW beat exact answers LATER.

## Reversible Computing

Landauer's Principle: Erasing information releases heat. Solution? Don't erase.

**Reversible Gates**: Can run backwards
**Adiabatic Computing**: Slow state changes
**Ballistic Computing**: Momentum carries computation

Theoretical possibility: Zero-energy computation. Practical reality: Very difficult.

## DNA Storage: Library of Everything

DNA stores 2 bits per nucleotide. That's 455 exabytes per gram.

**Process**:
1. Encode data as ATCG sequences
2. Synthesize DNA strands
3. Store (lasts thousands of years)
4. Sequence to read
5. Decode to data

All of humanity's data could fit in a closet. Reading/writing is slow, but density is unmatched.

## Exotic Possibilities

**Topological Quantum Computing**: Braid anyons in 2D
**Time Crystals**: Perpetual motion in time dimension
**Black Hole Computing**: Ultimate information density
**Quantum Gravity Computing**: Compute with spacetime itself

Most are theoretical. Some might be impossible. All are fascinating.

## The Computational Zoo

We're discovering computation everywhere:

- Soap bubbles compute minimal surfaces
- Slime molds solve mazes
- Markets compute prices
- Evolution computes organisms
- Maybe reality computes itself

"Computer" might be too narrow. "Information processor" captures more. The universe seems to process information at every scale.

## Hybrid Future

The future isn't quantum OR classical OR biological. It's AND.

**Quantum**: For specific hard problems
**Classical**: For general computation
**Neural**: For pattern recognition
**Biological**: For evolution/optimization
**Optical**: For communication/AI

Each paradigm handles what it does best. Orchestrated by classical computers, because someone needs to be in charge.

## The Real Mystery Is...

Why are there so many ways to compute?

We discovered computation in electronics. Then in quantum mechanics. Then in biology. Then in light, in chemistry, in everything we look at closely enough.

It's as if computation isn't something we invented but something we keep discovering. Like finding out that not only can you build boats from wood, but also from metal, plastic, paper - anything that displaces water. The principle is deeper than the implementation.

Maybe computation is what the universe does. Not just in computers, but everywhere. Particles computing their interactions. Cells computing their responses. Brains computing thoughts. Galaxies computing their evolution.

We thought we were building calculators. We might have been discovering the universe's operating system. Every new computing paradigm reveals more of how reality processes information.

The deepest mystery: If everything computes, what is being computed? Is the universe calculating something? Are we part of the calculation or the result?

We started by teaching sand to think. We might end by discovering that thinking is what sand - and everything else - naturally does.
