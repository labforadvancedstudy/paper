# Supply

## Core Insight
The economy's offer: what's available shapes what's possible - abundance and scarcity in material form.

Supply is the "have" side of economics. It's every apple in the market, every worker seeking employment, every bitcoin in circulation. Supply is potential waiting to meet desire.

Supply dynamics:
- **Production** - making more increases supply
- **Discovery** - finding new sources adds supply
- **Storage** - saving adds future supply
- **Destruction** - loss reduces supply
- **Hoarding** - removes from active supply

Supply responds to incentives:
- High prices encourage more production
- Low prices discourage production
- Technology can increase supply
- Resources limit ultimate supply
- Time affects perishable supply

The key insight: supply isn't fixed. Human ingenuity constantly finds ways to increase supply - better farming, new materials, efficiency gains. Yet physical laws set ultimate boundaries.

Supply tells half the economic story. It's the stage on which demand performs. Together they dance the eternal market waltz, seeking the balance point called price.
