# Power

## Core Insight
Power is the ability to make something happen that wouldn't happen otherwise - to change the course of events through will.

Power isn't a thing you hold, like a ball. It's a relationship - it only exists between entities. A has power over B when A can affect what B does, thinks, or becomes.

The peculiar thing about power: it exists only when exercised or when others believe it could be exercised. An unloaded gun can have power if others think it's loaded. A law has power only if people follow it or fear the consequences of not following it.

Power flows through multiple channels:
- Physical force (the crudest but most immediate)
- Economic resources (money, food, shelter)
- Information control (who knows what)
- Social position (where you stand in the web)
- Symbolic authority (the crown, the badge, the title)
- Emotional influence (love, fear, hope)

But here's the paradox: absolute power is impossible. Even the most powerful dictator depends on others to execute their will. Power always requires at least minimal cooperation from those subjected to it.
