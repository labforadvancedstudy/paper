# Company Culture

## Core Insight
Culture is the company's operating system - the invisible software that runs on human hardware, determining how decisions get made when no one's watching.

Culture isn't perks or posters. It's the unwritten rules everyone knows: how we handle conflict, what we celebrate, what we punish, how we decide. It's what happens by default, the organizational water everyone swims in but no one sees.

Strong cultures are coherent - every signal points the same direction. Weak cultures are contradictory - espoused values clash with rewarded behaviors. Toxic cultures actively damage. Healthy cultures actively heal. Most are somewhere between.

Culture scales non-linearly. Small company culture spreads person-to-person. Large company culture requires systems, symbols, stories. But culture can't be mandated, only cultivated. It grows from repeated behaviors becoming embedded beliefs.
