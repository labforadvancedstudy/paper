# Level 1: Names for Things - The First Words
*When sounds became meanings*

> "In the beginning was the Word." - John 1:1
>
> "The name is the thing." - Ancient Egyptian belief

## The Naming Explosion

Lingua wakes to a world suddenly nameable. Yesterday's pointing becomes today's words. "Buh" (berries), "Mah" (mother), "Wawa" (water). Each name pins down a piece of floating reality.

The tribe goes mad with naming. Every thing needs its sound. The waterfall roars "Shraaaaa." The fire crackles "Krkrkr." Birds are "Tweet-tweet." Natural sounds become names - humanity's first onomatopoeia.

## The Magic of Names

Early humans believe names have power:

**Name Magic**:
- Know something's true name = control it
- Speaking name summons presence
- Secret names protect from enemies
- Taboo names bring bad luck

This isn't primitive confusion. It's recognizing language's genuine power. Say "lion" in the dark and hearts race. Names DO summon presence - in mind.

## The First Vocabulary

Reconstructing humanity's first word list:

**Universal Early Words** (found in all cultures):
- Mama/Papa (easy sounds + important people)
- Water (necessity of life)
- Fire (danger and warmth)
- Food terms (eat, meat, fruit)
- Body parts (hand, eye, head)
- Simple actions (go, come, give)
- Yes/No (affirmation/negation)

**The Pattern**: Concrete over abstract, survival over luxury, nouns over verbs.

## Sound Symbolism

Not all name-thing connections are arbitrary:

**Size-Sound Mapping**:
- Big things: low, back vowels (boulder, huge)
- Small things: high, front vowels (tiny, wee)

**Shape-Sound Mapping**:
- Round: voiced consonants (ball, globe)
- Sharp: voiceless stops (prick, cut)

**The Bouba/Kiki Effect**: Show anyone these shapes:
- Rounded blob → "Bouba"
- Spiky star → "Kiki"
98% agree across all cultures.

Some sound-meaning connections are wired deep.

## One Word, Many Uses

L1 words are Swiss Army knives:

"Mama!" means:
- "Mother!" (naming)
- "I want mother!" (desire)
- "Where is mother?" (question)
- "Mother is here!" (declaration)
- "Help me, mother!" (plea)

Context and tone carry what grammar will later specify. Holophrastic stage - one word equals whole sentence.

## The Cognitive Revolution

Names create new mental powers:

**Without names**: Experience fades with attention
**With names**: Can think about absent things

"Lion" lets you:
- Remember yesterday's lion
- Warn about tomorrow's lion
- Plan for hypothetical lions
- Teach others about lions
- Dream of lions

Names are cognitive handles. They let us grab and manipulate reality mentally.

## Categories Emerge

Names create categories:

All these different things become "tree":
- Tall oak
- Short pine
- Fruit tree
- Dead tree

The name groups them. Creates "treeness" as concept. Plato's Forms are born in naming.

But languages carve differently:
- Russian has two blues (goluboy/siniy)
- Japanese has one blue-green (ao)
- Pirahã has no numbers
- Inuit has... not actually 50 words for snow (myth!)

The names available shape what speakers notice.

## The Social Contract

Names require agreement:

Lingua calls red berries "buh." Others must accept this. If everyone uses different names, no communication. Language is democracy - majority rules on meanings.

**Dialect formation**:
- Mountain tribe: "buh" 
- Valley tribe: "ber"
- Coast tribe: "pum"

Geographic separation creates linguistic variation. First step toward different languages.

## The Noun Bias

Why do nouns come first?

**Cognitive reasons**:
- Objects are stable, actions fleeting
- Easier to point at things than processes
- Things persist, events vanish
- Concrete before abstract

**Social reasons**:
- Need to coordinate about objects
- Warn about dangers (predators, poison)
- Share resources (food, water)
- Trade and exchange

Verbs come later. First describe what IS, then what HAPPENS.

## Memory Palace

Names enable memory techniques:

**Oral cultures develop**:
- Genealogies (name lists preserve history)
- Catalogs (naming preserves knowledge)
- Stories (names in narrative structures)
- Songlines (landscape names in order)

Without writing, names must be memorable. Rhythm, rhyme, repetition, narrative - all serve memory.

## The Neurological Shift

Brain changes with naming:

**Left hemisphere specializes**:
- Broca's area: Speech production
- Wernicke's area: Speech comprehension
- Angular gyrus: Connecting sound-meaning

**New capacities**:
- Categorical perception
- Symbolic reference
- Displaced reference
- Mental time travel

The naming brain is fundamentally different from pre-naming brain.

## Problems with L1

But one-word stage hits limits:

Can't express:
- Relationships between things
- Who does what to whom
- When things happened
- How things connect

"Lion!" warns. But was lion coming or going? Big or small? One or many? Hungry or satisfied?

Need combinations. Need grammar. Need L2.

## Bridge to L2

Lingua, now parent herself, watches her child struggle. The child points at bird eating berries: "Bird! Buh!"

Two words. Not random. Ordered. Agent and action beginning to connect. The child has invented syntax. Grammar stirs in the two-word sentence.

Others notice. Copy. Elaborate. "Bird buh" becomes standard for that situation. Combinations multiply. Language explodes into L2.

**The Real Mystery Is...**

Why do children learn names so easily? Show a child a rabbit, say "bunny" once. They generalize instantly to all rabbits, but not to cats or squirrels. How do they know where category boundaries are?

Maybe categories pre-exist in mind, waiting for names. Maybe universe comes pre-parsed, and names just reveal its joints. Maybe naming is recognition, not invention.

Or maybe we create reality by naming it, and children are universe teaching itself how to divide itself up.

"Buh," says young Lingua, creating berries.

*"Adam's first task was naming animals. Humanity's first achievement was the same. We are the species that can't encounter anything without asking 'What's that called?'"*
