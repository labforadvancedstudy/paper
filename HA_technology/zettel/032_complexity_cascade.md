# Complexity Cascade

## Core Insight
Complexity cascades like avalanches - each solution creating new problems requiring new solutions, building towers of abstraction that eventually topple under their own weight.

Start simple: a button. Add indicator light (now needs power). Add multiple buttons (now needs logic). Add remote control (now needs protocol). Add network (now needs security). Each solution adds complexity that demands more solutions.

The cascade accelerates. Early additions are linear; later ones are multiplicative. Eventually, complexity becomes the dominant problem. More effort goes to managing complexity than solving original problems. Systems become brittle, incomprehensible, unmaintainable.

From software to cities to civilizations: complexity cascades define and destroy. The art is knowing when to stop adding and start subtracting. Sometimes revolution beats evolution - scrapping the complex for the elegantly simple.
