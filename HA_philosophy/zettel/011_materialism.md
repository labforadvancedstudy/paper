# Materialism

## Core Insight
Everything is atoms and void - the ancient guess that turned out mostly right.

## The Atoms Win (Mostly)

Democritus called it: reality is atoms moving in void. Everything else - colors, meanings, gods - just patterns in the atom dance.

L1: Stuff is solid and real
L2: Matter opposes spirit
L3: Only matter exists
L4: Matter follows laws
L5: Matter is energy (E=mc²)
L6: Matter is mostly empty
L7: "Matter" is a construct
L8: Matter is information
L9: Matter/energy/information unite

The modern twist: atoms are mostly empty. Matter is fields. Fields are... math? The materialists won by making matter increasingly immaterial.
