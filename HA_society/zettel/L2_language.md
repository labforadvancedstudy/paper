# Language

## Core Insight
The technology that turns private thoughts into shared reality, enabling cooperation beyond line of sight.

Before language, cooperation meant doing together. With language, we can plan together, remember together, dream together. A mother can tell her child about dangers they've never seen. Humans can coordinate hunts, share tool-making techniques, pass down stories.

Language isn't just communication - it's reality construction. The words we have shape the thoughts we can think. Inuit languages have multiple words for snow because distinction matters for survival. English has hundreds of words for money because... well.

Every word is a social agreement: we all pretend these mouth noises mean something, and because we all pretend together, they do.
