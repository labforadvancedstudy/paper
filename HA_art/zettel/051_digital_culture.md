# Digital Culture

## Core Insight
Born-digital natives - where reality and virtuality merge, creating new forms of human expression that exist only in networked spaces, fundamentally rewiring how culture propagates.

Digital culture characteristics:
- Networked by default
- Remix as standard
- Viral as aspiration
- Anonymous/pseudonymous options
- Global/instant reach

New cultural forms emerge:
- Memes (visual language evolution)
- TikTok dances (embodied virality)
- Discord aesthetics (community-specific)
- Twitch performance (live interaction)
- NFT communities (ownership culture)

Attention economy rules:
- Engagement metrics dominate
- Algorithm as curator
- Virality over longevity
- Scroll determines survival
- Like economy psychology

Digital natives think differently:
- Multiple identity comfort
- Privacy as performance
- Authenticity constructed
- Community fluid
- Reality augmented

Old institutions adapt/resist:
- Museums Instagram strategies
- Galleries virtual viewing
- Critics on Twitter
- Artists as influencers
- Collectors buying JPEGs

Contradictions multiply:
- Democratization vs. platform control
- Global reach vs. echo chambers
- Free culture vs. NFT scarcity
- Connection vs. isolation
- Information abundance vs. wisdom scarcity

Future already here:
- AI-generated culture
- Metaverse galleries
- Crypto patronage
- DAO governance
- Post-human aesthetics

Yet human needs persist: meaning, beauty, connection, transcendence. Digital enables new forms, doesn't eliminate needs.
