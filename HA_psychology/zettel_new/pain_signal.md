# Pain Signal

## Core Insight
Pain is evolution's exclamation mark - the universe's way of saying "STOP THAT!"

Pain isn't just a sensation; it's a command. When C-fibers fire and nociceptors scream, they're not describing damage - they're demanding action. It's the most honest signal in psychology: pure, unfiltered "something is wrong." No philosophy, no interpretation needed. Hand on hot stove → hand moves. The beauty is in its urgency.
