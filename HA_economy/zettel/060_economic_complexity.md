# Economic Complexity

## Core Insight
Economic complexity measures not just how much an economy produces, but how many different capabilities it combines - like measuring intelligence rather than strength.

Consider two countries with equal GDP. One exports only oil. The other exports cars, chemicals, electronics, and software. Which is more developed? Complexity economics says the second, because making cars requires thousands of capabilities - metallurgy, electronics, design, logistics, quality control. Oil just requires drilling.

Hidalgo and Hausmann mapped this insight. Products are like Scrabble words - they require specific letter combinations (capabilities). Countries that can make many products have many letters. The Product Space shows which products are "near" others in capability space.

This explains development puzzles. Why did Nokia's collapse not destroy Finland? Because the capabilities for making phones (precision engineering, software, design) easily pivoted to other industries. Why can't oil countries diversify? Because oil capabilities don't transfer.

Complexity also predicts growth. Countries with more complexity than their income suggests tend to grow fast (China in 1990s). Countries with less complexity than income tend to stagnate (resource exporters).

The deep insight: economies aren't just about having resources or capital. They're about the combinatorial explosion of capabilities. Development is less like accumulating wealth and more like evolving a more complex genome. Knowledge, embedded in networks of humans and institutions, is the real wealth of nations.
