# Emotional Granularity

**Core Concept**: The precision of your emotion words determines the richness of your emotional experience.

## One-Line Definition
People with fifty words for sadness experience fifty shades; those with just "sad" live in emotional black and white.

## Simple Mental Model
Like a painter with three colors versus three hundred - more emotional vocabulary creates more nuanced inner life.

## Key Mechanism
1. Language provides emotion categories
2. Categories enable discrimination
3. Discrimination allows regulation
4. Regulation improves outcomes

## Practical Example
Instead of "angry": frustrated, irritated, indignant, furious, exasperated. Each word carves out a different experience and suggests different responses.

## Common Misconception
Emotions exist independent of words. Actually, learning new emotion words literally creates new emotional experiences you couldn't have before.
