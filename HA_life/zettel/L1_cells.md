# Cells

## Core Insight
The smallest unit that can be called alive - a droplet of organized water that somehow decides to keep being organized.

A cell is a bubble that refuses to pop. It's water pretending to be separate from other water. It builds a membrane - a boundary that says "inside is different from outside" - and then spends all its energy maintaining that difference.

But here's the magic: it's not just a container. It's a container that makes more containers. Every cell came from another cell, stretching back in an unbroken chain to the first cell that figured out this trick 4 billion years ago. You are colony of 37 trillion cells, all agreeing to be you.

Each cell is a tiny factory: power plants (mitochondria), instruction manuals (DNA), protein builders (ribosomes), trash collectors (lysosomes). It's a city in a droplet, somehow coordinating millions of molecular interactions every second.

The paradox: a cell must be separate to exist, yet open to survive. It needs a boundary to define itself, but must constantly exchange with the outside. Too closed = death. Too open = death. Life exists in the sweet spot between.
