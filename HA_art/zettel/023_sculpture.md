# Sculpture

## Core Insight
Art in the round - occupying real space with real mass, forcing viewers to move, circle, confront physical presence that shares their world.

Sculpture is subtraction and addition:
- Carving: revealing form within (Michelangelo's prisoners)
- Modeling: building up form (clay, wax, plasticity)
- Casting: negative to positive transformation
- Construction: assembling disparate elements
- Installation: environment as sculpture

Material speaks before form:
- Marble: eternal, precious, light-transmitting
- Bronze: permanent, reproducible, patina-developing
- Wood: organic, grain-following, living history
- Steel: industrial, weldable, modern strength
- Found objects: readymade poetry, Duchamp's legacy
- Digital fabrication: computer to material direct

Sculpture changed when it stepped off the pedestal. Brancusi's bases became part of work. Minimalists put boxes on floor. Earth artists made landscape sculpture. Suddenly everything was possible.

Touch prohibition frustrates sculpture's nature. We understand form through hands, yet "don't touch" signs everywhere. Some artists rebel - Felix Gonzalez-Torres's candy piles consumed by viewers. Social sculpture born.

Contemporary sculpture explodes categories:
- Kinetic: movement added
- Sound: audio dimensional
- Light: immaterial material
- Bio-art: living sculpture
- Social practice: human interaction sculpted
- Virtual: 3D without physics

Yet traditional persists. Bronze foundries busy. Marble still carved. Hand-building clay connects contemporary to prehistoric. Something primal about forming matter with hands.
