# Reality Shaping

## Core Insight
Companies don't just operate within reality - they actively shape it, creating new categories of existence, possibility, and human experience.

Before Ford, "commuting" didn't exist. Before Facebook, "social networking" was face-to-face. Before Amazon, "one-click ordering" was impossible. Companies create new realities by making them, then we inhabit these created worlds as if they always existed.

The shaping goes deeper than products. Companies create: new behaviors (checking phones), new identities (personal brands), new relationships (parasocial connections), new temporalities (24/7 availability). They don't just serve needs - they create needs by creating new forms of life.

We live in composite reality - part natural, part corporate-created. The boundary blurs. Is urban life natural or created? Is digital communication real or artificial? Companies have shaped reality so thoroughly that "natural" human life becomes archaeological question.
