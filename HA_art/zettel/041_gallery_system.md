# Gallery System

## Core Insight
The taste-making machine - where white cubes transform objects into art, dealers become cultural gatekeepers, and market value masquerades as cultural worth.

Gallery system structures art world:
- Commercial galleries (sales primary)
- Vanity galleries (artists pay)
- Artist-run spaces (alternative model)
- Online galleries (new disruption)
- Mega-galleries (global empires)

Gallery functions multiply:
- Selection (what's shown)
- Promotion (creating buzz)
- Sales (finding collectors)
- Career building (artist development)
- Market making (price setting)

Power dynamics embedded:
- 50/50 split standard (but negotiable)
- Exclusive representation (ownership?)
- Exhibition schedules (career rhythms)
- Collector access (network capital)
- Price discipline (market control)

Physical space speaks:
- White cube as neutral (not)
- Lighting creates drama
- Height implies importance
- Grouping suggests dialogue
- Price lists hidden (ask)

Contemporary challenges:
- Instagram bypasses galleries
- Direct-to-collector sales
- Art fairs dominate calendar
- Online viewing rooms
- NFT marketplaces parallel

Yet galleries persist. Why? Curation adds value. Physical encounter matters. Social validation continues. Collectors want guidance. Artists need infrastructure.

Alternative models emerge:
- Cooperative galleries
- Pop-up exhibitions
- Apartment galleries
- Virtual galleries
- Blockchain galleries
