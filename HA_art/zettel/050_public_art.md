# Public Art

## Core Insight
Democracy's aesthetic test - where art escapes private spaces to confront everyone, raising questions about beauty, representation, and the right to visual environments.

Public art tensions:
- Imposed vs. invited
- Permanent vs. temporary
- Monument vs. intervention
- Decorative vs. challenging
- Consensus vs. provocation

Forms evolve:
- Monuments (memory markers)
- Murals (wall democracy)
- Sculpture (space activation)
- Performance (temporary disruption)
- Social practice (community engagement)

Stakeholder complexity:
- Artists (vision/compromise)
- Commissioners (agenda/budget)
- Communities (representation/resistance)
- Governments (control/culture)
- Publics (multiple/conflicting)

Controversy inevitable:
- Serra's Tilted Arc (removed)
- Confederate monuments (contested)
- Percent for art (mandated)
- Graffiti (vandalism/art)
- Surveillance aesthetics (smart cities)

Success measures what?
- Popular approval?
- Critical acclaim?
- Tourist photos?
- Community pride?
- Longevity?

Contemporary approaches:
- Community co-creation
- Temporary proposals
- Digital/physical hybrids
- Ecological integration
- Decolonial monuments

Public space scarce:
- Privatization increases
- Security dominates
- Commercial priority
- Homogenization risk
- Access limited

Yet public art persists. Streets as galleries. Cities as canvases. Democracy requiring aesthetic dimension. Everyone a viewer, like it or not.
