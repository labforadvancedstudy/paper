# Sharing Food

## Core Insight
The act of sharing food transforms eating from survival to society - creating bonds stronger than blood.

No other animal does this like we do. A lion might let cubs eat first, but humans? We share with strangers. We invent elaborate rules about who eats what, when, how. We make eating together a ritual that says "you're one of us."

Think about it: giving away food reduces your survival chances. It's evolutionarily insane. Yet every human culture does it. The first act of hospitality is always food. The greatest insult is eating alone while others hunger.

Sharing food creates debt that can't be repaid, only passed forward. It's the first economy, the first social contract, the first "I'll help you today, maybe you'll help me tomorrow."
