## The Gateway to Awareness

The thalamus acts as consciousness's gatekeeper -
damage it, and awareness itself disappears,
though the brain continues functioning.

### The Central Relay Station
- All sensory inputs (except smell) pass through
- Not passive relay but active filter
- Decides what reaches consciousness
- The attention mechanism embodied

### The Thalamic Switch
- Awake: Gates open, cortex engaged
- Sleep: Gates closed, consciousness dims
- Anesthesia: Thalamic function suppressed
- Coma: Thalamic damage, no awareness

### Thalamocortical Loops
- Not one-way but reciprocal
- Cortex tells thalamus what to prioritize
- Dynamic feedback creates stable states
- The substrate of sustained attention

### The Consciousness Proof
Thalamic function correlates with:
- Subjective awareness
- Reportable experience  
- The difference between conscious and unconscious
