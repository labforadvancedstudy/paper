# Economy as Network

## Core Insight
The economy isn't a machine with parts but a network with connections - value flows through relationships, not just transactions, and the topology matters more than the nodes.

Traditional economics focuses on agents and markets. Network economics sees connections. Who trades with whom? Who trusts whom? Who influences whom? The same actors with different connections create entirely different economies.

Consider supply chains. They're not chains but networks - webs of relationships where disruption anywhere propagates everywhere. COVID revealed this brutally. A chip factory in Taiwan shuts down, car plants in Detroit stop. The economy is more connected and fragile than we imagined.

Financial networks show this starkly. Banks lend to banks who lend to banks. In good times, connections spread prosperity. In bad times, they spread contagion. Lehman Brothers wasn't that big, but it was centrally connected. Its failure cascaded through the network.

Social networks are economic networks. Jobs come through weak ties. Innovation clusters where idea networks are dense. Trust networks enable trade where legal systems fail. Social capital is network capital.

The network view changes everything. Inequality isn't just about individual wealth but network position. Development isn't just about resources but connection patterns. Resilience isn't about strength but redundancy and diversity of links.

We're discovering the economy is less like a machine to be optimized and more like an ecosystem to be cultivated.
