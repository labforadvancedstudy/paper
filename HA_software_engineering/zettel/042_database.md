# database
- **Level**: L4
- **Definition**: The persistent memory of applications
- **Korean**: 데이터베이스
- **Context**: Where data goes to live forever (or until someone runs DROP TABLE)

## Core Understanding
A database is civilization's attempt to fight entropy with structured persistence. It's a magical box where you put your data, perform ancient incantations (SQL), and hope it comes back when you need it. Like a dragon hoarding gold, but the gold is rows and the dragon breathes ACID.

## Deeper Insights
- **ACID Properties**: The four noble truths of data persistence
- **CAP Theorem**: You can't have your cake and query it too
- **Normalization**: The art of spreading data across tables like butter on too much bread
- **NoSQL**: When you realize not everything fits in rectangles

## Technical Details
```sql
-- The eternal struggle between elegance and performance
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS human_condition (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    hope VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    despair TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL, -- Soft delete, because nothing truly dies
    
    CONSTRAINT hope_not_empty CHECK (LENGTH(hope) > 0),
    INDEX idx_temporal (created_at, updated_at),
    -- Foreign key to the void
    FOREIGN KEY (existential_dread_id) REFERENCES void(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- The query that takes 0.001ms in dev and 47 minutes in production
SELECT meaning FROM life WHERE purpose IS NOT NULL; -- Returns 0 rows
```

## Connection to Truth
Databases embody humanity's deepest desire: to remember. Every INSERT is an act of defiance against the universe's tendency toward forgetfulness. Every SELECT is a prayer that what we stored still exists. Every DELETE is a small death.

## When It Matters
- **Data Persistence**: When RAM isn't permanent enough
- **Complex Queries**: Finding needles in digital haystacks
- **Transactions**: Ensuring all-or-nothing operations
- **Scale**: When Excel finally admits defeat

## Human Element
Database administrators are the unsung heroes of the digital age, guardians of our collective memory. They wake at 3 AM to fix what a developer broke at 5 PM. They speak in foreign keys and worship at the altar of the query optimizer. They know that "it works on my machine" means nothing when production data is 10,000x larger.
