# Reality Engineering

## Core Insight
Reality engineering is the ultimate technology - not just building within reality but rebuilding reality itself, making physics programmable and existence editable.

We've always engineered reality locally. Agriculture reshapes ecosystems. Cities create new environments. But emerging technologies go deeper: quantum computers exploit superposition, synthetic biology rewrites life's code, virtual reality creates new sensory worlds.

The frontier approaches: manipulating spacetime (Alcubierre drives), creating pocket universes (cosmological engineering), editing physical constants (fine-tuning reality). Science fiction becomes engineering challenge.

The philosophical earthquake: if reality is engineerable, what's fundamental? Perhaps only logic itself - the constraints on any possible reality. Everything else becomes design choice. We're approaching godlike power with monkey wisdom.
