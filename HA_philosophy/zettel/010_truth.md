# Truth

## Core Insight
The correspondence that might not correspond - reality's self-portrait.

## The Mirror Problem

What makes "snow is white" true? That snow is white. But what makes snow white? Our perception of light wavelengths. But what makes our perception accurate? Its correspondence to reality. But how do we check reality except through perception?

L1: True is what works
L2: True is divine revelation
L3: True is logical consistency
L4: True is correspondence to reality
L5: True is coherence with beliefs
L6: True is warranted assertion
L7: "Truth" is power's tool
L8: True is predictive accuracy
L9: Truth is a modeling relation

Tarski saved us: "Snow is white" is true iff snow is white. But he just pushed the problem up a level.
