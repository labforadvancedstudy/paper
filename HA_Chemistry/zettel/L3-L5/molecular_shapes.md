# Molecular Shapes

## Core Insight
Electron pairs repel each other, forcing molecules into specific 3D shapes that determine their function.

Water is bent, not straight. Carbon dioxide is linear. Methane is tetrahedral. Ammonia is pyramidal. Why? VSEPR - Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion. Electrons hate crowding, push apart as far as possible.

These shapes matter enormously. Water's bent shape makes it polar - positive on one side, negative on the other. This polarity lets water dissolve salts, climb trees, form ice that floats. If water were linear, life wouldn't exist.

Proteins fold into precise shapes. Change one atom, change the shape, change the function. Lock-and-key enzyme action depends on molecular geometry. Drug design is shape matching. Biology is applied molecular geometry.
