# Cultural Exchange

## Core Insight
The delicate dance of difference - where cultures meet, mix, and sometimes clash in the contact zones of art, creating new forms while risking appropriation and erasure.

Exchange mechanisms vary:
- Residencies (artists travel)
- Exhibitions (works travel)
- Collaborations (ideas travel)
- Digital sharing (instant access)
- Migration (people carry culture)

Power imbalances persist:
- Who travels where?
- Which cultures "discovered"?
- Whose aesthetic dominates?
- What gets translated?
- Who profits?

Historical patterns repeat:
- Primitivism's extraction
- Orientalism's projection
- Modernism's appropriation
- Multiculturalism's tokenism
- Globalization's homogenization

Ethical navigation required:
- Citation practices
- Permission protocols
- Benefit sharing
- Community involvement
- Long-term relationships

Positive exchanges create:
- Hybrid innovations
- Expanded vocabularies
- Challenged assumptions
- Solidarity networks
- Mutual enrichment

Contemporary complications:
- Digital enables/flattens
- Identity politics heightened
- Colonial histories present
- Economic disparities real
- Climate limits travel

Strategies emerging:
- Slow exchange (long-term)
- Reciprocal programs
- Community protocols
- Indigenous leadership
- South-South connections

Key tension: How to share without stealing? Learn without extracting? Collaborate without dominating? Honor difference while finding connection? No easy answers, only better questions.
