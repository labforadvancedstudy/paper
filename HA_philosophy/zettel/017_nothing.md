# Nothing

## Core Insight
The absence that presence requires - being's shadow twin.

## The Void That Isn't Empty

Try to think nothing. You can't. Even imagining emptiness fills it with the idea of emptiness. Nothing is the most something of all concepts.

L1: Darkness, silence, void
L2: Chaos before creation
L3: Non-being as opposite
L4: Logical negation
L5: Nothingness nauseates
L6: Zero as placeholder
L7: Emptiness is form
L8: Quantum vacuum seethes
L9: Nothing/everything same

Buddhist smile: emptiness is not empty of emptiness. The void is pregnant with possibility.
