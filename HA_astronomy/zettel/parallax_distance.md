# Parallax Distance

## Core Insight
By measuring how stars appear to shift against the background as Earth orbits the Sun, we turned geometry into a cosmic ruler - the first rung on the distance ladder to the universe.

Hold your finger at arm's length and alternately close each eye. Your finger appears to jump against the background. That's parallax - the apparent shift in position due to changing viewpoint. Earth's orbit provides a 300-million-kilometer baseline for cosmic parallax. Nearby stars shift slightly against distant stars as we orbit the Sun.

Friedrich Bessel first measured stellar parallax in 1838 for 61 Cygni: 0.314 arcseconds, placing it 11.4 light-years away. Suddenly, star distances weren't speculation but measurement. The parsec (parallax second) was born: the distance at which 1 AU subtends 1 arcsecond, about 3.26 light-years. But parallax works only for nearby stars - beyond 100 parsecs, the shifts become unmeasurable. This limitation forced astronomers to develop other methods, building a "distance ladder" with parallax as the crucial first rung.
