# Depression Patterns

Stuck in negative loops.

Cognitive triad:
- Negative view of self
- Negative view of world
- Negative view of future

Behavioral spiral:
Feel bad → Do less → Feel worse

Biological factors:
- Serotonin dysregulation
- Inflammation markers
- Sleep disruption

Not just sadness.
Whole system dysfunction.
