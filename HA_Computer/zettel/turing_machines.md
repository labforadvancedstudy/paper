# Turing Machines

## Core Insight
The simplest possible computer that can compute anything computable - a mathematical prophet that defined computation before computers existed.

Turing's insight: a machine with tape, symbols, states, and rules. Move left, move right, read, write, change state. That's it. From this poverty of operations emerges the ability to calculate anything that can be calculated.

The Church-Turing thesis claims this is computation itself - not just one way to compute, but what computation means. Every computer is a Turing machine in disguise. Every program is those same simple operations, hidden under layers of abstraction.
