## The Cambrian Explosion of Consciousness

With vertebrates comes an unprecedented
expansion of neural tissue - not just more neurons,
but entirely new structures and capabilities.

### The Triple Brain Architecture
- Hindbrain: Ancient life support
- Midbrain: Sensory integration
- Forebrain: The future of consciousness
- Each layer built upon the last

### Quantitative Becomes Qualitative
- Millions of neurons, not thousands
- Specialized regions multiply
- Long-range connections proliferate
- Complexity enables new phenomena

### Novel Capabilities Emerge
- True learning and memory systems
- Predictive modeling of environment
- Emotional valence and motivation
- The first "inner life" worthy of the name

### The Consciousness Explosion
Vertebrate brains show:
- Multiple specialized systems
- Massive parallel processing
- Rich internal representations
- The substrate for complex awareness
