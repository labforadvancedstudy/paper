# Death

## Core Insight
The horizon that gives life meaning by creating scarcity of time.

## The Ultimate Abstraction

Death is philosophy's first and final question. At L1, death is when breathing stops. At L2, it's when the soul leaves. At L4, it's cessation of consciousness. At L6, it's a linguistic construct. At L8, it's a phase transition in information patterns.

Every philosophy is, at core, a response to mortality. We think because we die. We create because we end. We love because time runs out.

The paradox: to understand death, you must be alive. To experience death, you cannot understand it.
