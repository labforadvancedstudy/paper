# Stellar Lifecycle

## Core Insight
Stars aren't eternal lights but cosmic engines converting hydrogen to heavier elements, living and dying on timescales that dwarf human comprehension - we are literally made of stellar ash.

A star's life is a battle against gravity. Collapsing gas clouds heat until fusion ignites, creating outward pressure that balances gravitational collapse. This equilibrium defines the main sequence, where stars spend 90% of their lives fusing hydrogen to helium. But fusion creates ash that can't burn at current temperatures. The core contracts, heats up, ignites helium fusion. The star swells into a red giant.

Mass determines everything. Small stars die quietly as white dwarfs. Massive stars forge elements up to iron in successive shells, then collapse catastrophically. The supernova explosion creates elements heavier than iron and scatters them into space. These stellar ashes become new stars, planets, and people. We discovered this by combining spectroscopy (showing stellar compositions), nuclear physics (explaining energy sources), and observations of stars at different stages. Every atom in your body except hydrogen was forged in a star.
