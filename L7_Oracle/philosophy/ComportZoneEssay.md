## System 1 and System 2

"System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control."
"System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration."
- Daniel Kahneman (2011)

Although modeling the incredibly complex human brain remains a challenge, psychologist Daniel Kahneman's "dual process theory" suggests that we can simplify and explain human thinking using the concepts of System 1 and System 2 (Kahneman, 2011). System 1 is responsible for fast, intuitive, and automatic thinking, while System 2 handles slower, more logical, and analytical thinking. Most of our daily life is processed by System 1, but when faced with complex problems, System 2 intervenes and consciously thinks things through.

System 1 is associated with brain regions such as the amygdala, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, which are involved in emotional processing, habitual behavior, and motor control (Dolan, 2002; Yin & Knowlton, 2006). In contrast, System 2 is linked to the prefrontal cortex, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and hippocampus, which are responsible for higher-order cognitive functions, language comprehension, memory formation, spatial cognition, and attention (Miller & Cohen, 2001; Squire, 1992).

Human development involves the interaction between System 1 and System 2. In infancy, System 1 is underdeveloped, so most behaviors rely on System 2. However, as individuals progress through adolescence and adulthood, the knowledge and experiences acquired through System 2 become automated in System 1, enabling more efficient behavior (Casey et al., 2005; Giedd, 2015). By old age, most situations can be processed by System 1, reducing cognitive burden. These developmental differences in System 1 and System 2 may contribute to varying subjective perceptions of time across age groups.

## Comfort Zone

"The comfort zone is a behavioral state within which a person operates in an anxiety-neutral condition, using a limited set of behaviors to deliver a steady level of performance, usually without a sense of risk."
- Judith M. Bardwick (1991)

The comfort zone refers to the psychological comfort experienced in familiar and stable states, often discussed in psychology, self-help, and organizational behavior (White, 2009). The tendency to stay within one's comfort zone is related to the brain's evolutionary mechanism to minimize energy consumption. Despite accounting for only about 2% of body weight, the human brain consumes over 20% of the body's total energy (Raichle & Gusnard, 2002), and has evolved to optimize energy usage for survival (Nesse & Williams, 1994).

In the comfort zone, System 1 dominates, maintaining automatic and repetitive behavior patterns, allowing stable performance with minimal energy. Stepping out of the comfort zone requires conscious thinking and new attempts driven by System 2, consuming more energy (Duhigg, 2012). Consequently, the brain tends to stay within familiar patterns to reduce energy consumption, making individuals hesitant to embrace new challenges or changes.

However, remaining solely in the comfort zone can limit personal growth and development. New experiences and challenges activate System 2, enhancing problem-solving skills and creativity, potentially expanding one's capabilities in the long run (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990; Kaufman & Gregoire, 2016). Moreover, to adapt to rapidly changing environments and achieve innovation, organizations must encourage members to step out of their existing methods and try new approaches.

Nevertheless, excessive anxiety and stress from leaving the comfort zone may impair performance (Yerkes & Dodson, 1908). Therefore, it is essential to gradually experience appropriate levels of challenge, considering individual capabilities and circumstances. Expanding the comfort zone is crucial for unleashing one's potential and leading a more mature life, but it requires the wisdom to accept the current state and take steps forward rather than making overwhelming attempts.

## Aging and System 1

Cognitive decline emerges as people age, primarily related to the deterioration of System 2 functions. In old age, the capacity and efficiency of brain regions associated with System 2, such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, decrease, leading to declines in working memory, attention, and problem-solving abilities (Buckner, 2004; Salthouse, 2010). In contrast, System 1 is relatively less affected by aging. Research suggests that habitual behaviors and intuitive judgment abilities are relatively maintained in old age (Tentori et al., 2001; Samanez-Larkin et al., 2011).

In particular, the "use it or lose it" hypothesis has gained attention as an important theory explaining age-related cognitive decline. According to this hypothesis, a lack of cognitive stimulation leads to decreased brain plasticity and weakened neural connections, resulting in cognitive decline (Hultsch et al., 1999). Indeed, some longitudinal studies have reported that greater engagement in intellectual activities is associated with slower rates of cognitive decline (Wilson et al., 2002; Ghisletta et al., 2006), suggesting that actively engaging in cognitive activities can help maintain and enhance System 2 functions even in old age.

The imbalance between System 1 and System 2 provides important clues for understanding cognitive and behavioral characteristics in old age. For example, older adults' difficulties in learning new skills can be explained by the decline in System 2 abilities. Furthermore, older adults' increased reliance on existing habits or preferences can be interpreted as a result of the relatively greater role of System 1 (Mata et al., 2007). This suggests that cognitive and behavioral changes in old age are not merely the result of functional decline but rather a complex phenomenon arising from the dynamic interaction between the two systems.

## System 1, System 2, and Time Perception

The dual-system framework of System 1 and System 2 can also influence time perception.

When System 1 is operating, the time-tracking function may not be activated, leading to the perception that time is passing quickly. This can be interpreted as System 1 primarily processing unconscious and automated processes (Evans & Stanovich, 2013). The experience of losing track of time while immersed in daily activities may be related to the operation of System 1.

In contrast, System 2 can consciously monitor and control the passage of time. When System 2 is activated, more attentional resources are allocated to temporal information, which may lead to the perception that time is passing relatively slowly (Block & Zakay, 1997). However, individuals differ in their System 2 capacity and efficiency (Engle, 2002). If all of System 2's resources are allocated to processing complex tasks, there may be insufficient resources for time monitoring, leading to the perception that time is passing quickly (Brown, 1997).

As people age, System 2 functions tend to decline (Craik & Salthouse, 2011). In particular, the deterioration of prefrontal cortex functions leads to decreased working memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility (West, 1996). This influences time perception, with older adults tending to perceive time as passing more quickly compared to younger individuals (Friedman & Janssen, 2010). Furthermore, prolonged exposure to environments lacking cognitive stimulation can further weaken System 2 functions (Hultsch et al., 1999), potentially exacerbating the distortion of time perception.

In summary, the relative activation levels of System 1 and System 2, individual differences, and age-related changes can interactively influence time perception. This perspective may help understand the dynamism and diversity of time perception. However, empirical research on the time perception mechanisms of System 1 and System 2 is still lacking, and further experiential studies are needed to develop more sophisticated theories.

## Conclusion

This essay explored how the concepts of System 1 and System 2 can be useful for understanding human thinking and behavior. System 1 contributes to increasing the energy efficiency of daily life through fast and intuitive information processing, while System 2 enables analytical and conscious thinking, forming the basis for solving new problems and exercising creativity.

However, relying excessively on System 1 and remaining in the comfort zone can lead to the disuse of System 2, potentially accelerating cognitive decline and brain aging (Park et al., 2002; Hertzog et al., 2009). Therefore, deliberately stepping out of the comfort zone and utilizing System 2 can play a crucial role in delaying brain aging and maintaining cognitive functions.

This can also influence time perception. By activating System 2 and exposing oneself to new experiences and challenges, time may feel like it is passing more slowly (Wittmann & Lehnhoff, 2005; Flaherty, 2011). This is interpreted as the activation of System 2 enhancing attention and concentration, allocating more cognitive resources to temporal information processing.

Consequently, we need to actively utilize System 2 by continuously seeking new challenges and breaking away from the habit of staying comfortable. This can contribute not only to maintaining cognitive functions and delaying aging but also to enriching subjective experiences of life. Especially in old age, when System 2 functions tend to weaken, it becomes even more important to actively seek cognitive stimulation and embrace new experiences.

Although human thinking and behavior are driven by highly complex neural mechanisms, the System 1 and System 2 framework provides a useful tool for intuitively understanding this complexity. By appropriately utilizing this tool, we can metacognitively reflect on our inner selves and exercise the wisdom to make better choices. Furthermore, we can hope that these individual efforts will collectively become the driving force for innovation and development throughout organizations and society.
