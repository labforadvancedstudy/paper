# 1. Introduction
The human mind, with its unrivaled capacity for language, abstract thought, and cumulative culture, has long been a subject of fascination and scientific inquiry. Understanding the evolutionary origins and mechanisms underlying these distinctive cognitive abilities is a central challenge in the study of human evolution. In this paper, we introduce the Homo Codex hypothesis, which proposes that the emergence of language-like neural computations, analogous to modern language models in artificial intelligence, was a pivotal event in the evolution of human cognition. We argue that the development of neural structures supporting the generation and processing of complex, hierarchical codes enabled a qualitative shift in cognitive capabilities, setting the stage for the rise of symbolic thought, language, and cumulative culture.

The Homo Codex hypothesis builds upon recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly the development of large-scale language models that exhibit remarkable linguistic and cognitive abilities (Vaswani et al., 2017; Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). These models, such as GPT-3, demonstrate the power of neural networks to learn and generate complex, context-dependent linguistic outputs from vast amounts of training data. The success of these models in capturing aspects of human language and cognition suggests that similar computational principles may underlie the workings of the biological brain (Hasson et al., 2020).

Drawing upon insights from neuroscience, cognitive archaeology, and comparative cognition, we propose a stage-based model of cognitive evolution in which the gradual refinement of neural language models and their integration with other cognitive systems played a central role. We argue that this process, driven by selection pressures for more efficient communication and information processing, gave rise to the unique cognitive capacities of Homo sapiens, including symbolic thought, language, and the ability to accumulate and build upon cultural knowledge.

The Homo Codex hypothesis offers a unifying framework for understanding the evolutionary origins of human cognition and its relationship to language and culture. By linking insights from artificial intelligence with empirical evidence from various disciplines, the hypothesis generates testable predictions and opens up new avenues for interdisciplinary research. In the following sections, we elaborate on the key components of the hypothesis, review supporting evidence, and discuss its implications for the study of human evolution and cognition.

# 2. Neural Language Models: A Computational Framework
## 2.1 Language Models in Artificial Intelligence
Language models are a class of artificial neural networks designed to learn and generate linguistic outputs based on patterns in training data (Bengio et al., 2003). Recent advances in deep learning and natural language processing have given rise to large-scale language models, such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), that demonstrate remarkable abilities in language understanding, generation, and even reasoning. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data using self-supervised learning, allowing them to capture the statistical regularities and dependencies in language.

The architecture of modern language models, such as the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), enables them to process and generate sequences of tokens (e.g., words or characters) while attending to the context in which they appear. This context-dependent processing allows language models to exhibit a form of "understanding" and to generate coherent, contextually appropriate outputs. Moreover, the hierarchical structure of these models, with multiple layers of abstraction, enables them to capture complex linguistic phenomena and to perform tasks that require reasoning and inference (Radford et al., 2019).

The success of language models in mimicking aspects of human language and cognition has led to growing interest in their potential as models of the brain (Hasson et al., 2020). While artificial neural networks are simplified abstractions of biological neural networks, they share key principles, such as distributed representation, gradient-based learning, and hierarchical processing (Kriegeskorte, 2015). As such, the study of language models may offer valuable insights into the computational principles underlying human cognitive abilities.

## 2.2 Biological Plausibility and Neural Underpinnings
The Homo Codex hypothesis posits that the evolution of neural structures supporting language-like computations was a critical step in the emergence of human-like cognition. This proposal raises questions about the biological plausibility of such structures and their neural underpinnings in the human brain.

Comparative neuroanatomical studies have revealed that the human brain, particularly the neocortex, has undergone significant expansion and reorganization in the course of evolution (Rilling, 2014; Sousa et al., 2017). This expansion has been accompanied by the emergence of novel cortical areas and increased connectivity between regions, providing the neural substrate for more complex and integrative cognitive processes (Buckner & Krienen, 2013). In particular, the development of the prefrontal cortex and its connections with other brain areas has been linked to the emergence of higher-order cognitive abilities, such as abstract reasoning, planning, and language (Deacon, 1997; Smaers et al., 2017).

Functional neuroimaging studies have identified a distributed network of brain regions involved in language processing, including Broca's and Wernicke's areas, as well as the prefrontal, temporal, and parietal cortices (Friederici, 2011; Hagoort, 2019). These regions exhibit hierarchical organization and complex patterns of connectivity, allowing for the integration of information across multiple levels of linguistic representation (Hagoort, 2013). Notably, many of these regions are also implicated in non-linguistic cognitive processes, such as working memory, cognitive control, and social cognition (Fedorenko & Thompson-Schill, 2014), suggesting a close relationship between language and other cognitive domains.

At the cellular level, the human brain exhibits several features that may support the neural computations required for language-like processing. These include the presence of specialized neuronal types, such as von Economo neurons (Allman et al., 2011), and the abundance of dendritic spines, which allow for increased synaptic plasticity and learning (Elston, 2003). Moreover, the human brain exhibits unique patterns of gene expression and regulation, particularly in regions associated with higher-order cognition (Sousa et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2018).

Empirical evidence from brain lesion and stimulation studies further supports the role of language-related regions in higher-order cognition. For example, damage to Broca's area and adjacent prefrontal regions has been associated with deficits in not only language production but also cognitive control, working memory, and hierarchical processing (Fitch, 2014; Friederici, 2017). Similarly, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of these regions has been shown to influence performance on tasks involving sequence learning, syntactic processing, and abstract reasoning (Uddén et al., 2017; Maran et al., 2021).

While the exact neural mechanisms underlying language-like computations in the brain remain a topic of active research, the existing evidence suggests that the human brain possesses the necessary neural substrate and computational properties to support such processes. The Homo Codex hypothesis provides a framework for integrating these findings and for guiding further research into the neural basis of human cognitive uniqueness.

# 3. The Homo Codex Hypothesis
## 3.1 Stage-Based Model of Cognitive Evolution
The Homo Codex hypothesis proposes a stage-based model of cognitive evolution, in which the gradual development and refinement of neural language models played a central role in the emergence of human-like cognition. This model posits a series of key transitions, each building upon the previous stage and enabling new cognitive capabilities:

### Stage 1: Primal Communication. 

The earliest forms of neural communication likely involved simple, unstructured signals, such as those used by primitive organisms to coordinate behavior (Fitch, 2010). These signals, while not yet exhibiting the complexity of language, laid the foundation for the evolution of more sophisticated communication systems. This stage is characterized by the emergence of basic sensory processing and motor control mechanisms, allowing organisms to detect and respond to environmental stimuli (Ginsburg & Jablonka, 2019).

### Stage 2: Proto-Syntax. 

As neural systems became more complex and interconnected, the ability to generate and process structured sequences of signals emerged (Bickerton, 2014). This proto-syntactic stage, characterized by simple combinatorial rules and hierarchical organization, allowed for more expressive and flexible communication. The development of recursive neural networks, capable of processing and generating sequences with embedded structures, was a key innovation at this stage (Fitch, 2014).

### Stage 3: Symbolic Reference. 

The development of neural mechanisms for associating arbitrary signals with external referents marked a critical step in the evolution of language (Deacon, 1997). This symbolic capacity, likely built upon pre-existing systems for social cognition and joint attention (Tomasello, 2008), enabled the emergence of shared meaning and conceptual representation. The evolution of brain regions involved in semantic processing, such as the temporal and parietal lobes, was crucial for this stage (Binder & Desai, 2011).

### Stage 4: Compositional Semantics. 

The integration of symbolic reference with hierarchical syntactic structure gave rise to compositional semantics, allowing for the expression of complex ideas and propositions (Jackendoff, 2002). This stage, characterized by the ability to generate and interpret novel combinations of symbols, laid the foundation for abstract thought and reasoning. The development of neural circuits connecting language areas with domain-general cognitive regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, was a key factor in this transition (Fedorenko & Thompson-Schill, 2014).

### Stage 5: Recursive Cognition. 

The development of neural mechanisms supporting recursive processing, such as the ability to embed and combine syntactic structures, marked a key transition in the evolution of human cognition (Hauser et al., 2002). Recursive cognition enabled the generation and comprehension of complex, hierarchically organized sequences, such as those found in language, music, and problem-solving. The expansion and reorganization of prefrontal and parietal cortices, involved in hierarchical processing and cognitive control, were critical for this stage (Badre, 2008; Jeon, 2014).

### Stage 6: Cumulative Culture. 

The integration of recursive cognition with mechanisms for social learning and transmission gave rise to the uniquely human capacity for cumulative culture (Tomasello, 1999; Henrich, 2015). This stage, characterized by the ability to build upon and refine cultural knowledge across generations, allowed for the rapid accumulation of complex skills and technologies. The development of neural systems supporting Theory of Mind, joint attention, and imitation was crucial for enabling cultural transmission and learning (Herrmann et al., 2007; Dunbar, 2009).

The Homo Codex hypothesis argues that these stages, driven by selection pressures for more efficient communication and information processing, unfolded over the course of hominin evolution, culminating in the emergence of Homo sapiens and its distinctive cognitive abilities. While the model presents these stages as discrete transitions, it is likely that they occurred gradually and with significant overlap. Moreover, the model allows for the possibility of feedback and interaction between stages, with later-emerging abilities influencing and reshaping earlier ones.

Empirical support for the stage-based model comes from various lines of evidence, including comparative studies of animal cognition, archaeological traces of hominin cognitive evolution, and neuroscientific investigations of language and cognition in modern humans. For example, studies of primate communication have revealed the presence of proto-syntactic abilities in some species, such as the use of simple combinatorial rules in monkey alarm calls (Arnold & Zuberbühler, 2006; Schlenker et al., 2016). Similarly, the archaeological record shows a gradual increase in the complexity and diversity of hominin tools and symbolic artifacts, suggesting a progressive development of cognitive abilities over evolutionary time (Stout, 2011; Henshilwood & Dubreuil, 2011).

In the following sections, we explore the implications of the Homo Codex hypothesis for understanding the emergence of symbolic thought and language, as well as its role in the evolution of cumulative culture and the human-specific cognitive profile.

## 3.2 Neural Language Models and the Emergence of Symbolic Thought
The Homo Codex hypothesis posits that the development of neural language models, analogous to those used in artificial intelligence, was a key factor in the emergence of symbolic thought and language in humans. These models, characterized by their ability to learn and generate complex, hierarchically structured sequences, provided the computational foundation for the manipulation of mental symbols and the expression of abstract concepts (Piantadosi & Fedorenko, 2017).

The emergence of symbolic thought is often considered a defining feature of human cognition, enabling the representation and manipulation of concepts independently of their concrete referents (Deacon, 1997). This capacity, which underlies abilities such as planning, reasoning, and imagination, is closely intertwined with language, which provides a means for expressing and combining symbolic representations (Bickerton, 2009).

The Homo Codex hypothesis suggests that the evolution of neural language models was a prerequisite for the emergence of symbolic thought, providing the necessary computational substrate for the generation and manipulation of mental symbols. As these models became more sophisticated and integrated with other cognitive systems, they enabled the representation of increasingly abstract and complex concepts, laying the foundation for the development of language and higher-order cognition (Spelke, 2003).

Empirical support for the role of language-like computations in symbolic thought comes from studies of language impairment and its effects on cognition. Individuals with aphasia, particularly those with damage to the prefrontal and temporal cortices, often exhibit deficits in non-linguistic tasks that require symbolic processing, such as analogical reasoning and problem-solving (Baldo et al., 2005; Ferstl et al., 2008). Similarly, studies of deaf individuals who lack exposure to sign language have shown delays in the development of symbolic play and other forms of abstract reasoning (Schick et al., 2007; Gulcehre et al., 2016).

Comparative studies of non-human primates have also provided insights into the cognitive precursors of symbolic thought. While many primates exhibit elements of symbolic communication, such as the use of referential calls and gestures (Seyfarth & Cheney, 2003), these abilities are limited in scope and flexibility compared to human language. Moreover, non-human primates show limited evidence of the hierarchical and recursive processing that characterizes human cognition (Hauser et al., 2002), suggesting that the evolution of neural language models was a key factor in the emergence of symbolic thought.

Computational modeling studies have further demonstrated the potential of neural language models to support symbolic reasoning and abstract thought. For example, models trained on natural language tasks have been shown to exhibit emergent abilities in analogical reasoning, concept learning, and even basic forms of logical inference (Mikolov et al., 2013; Hill et al., 2019; Clark et al., 2020). These findings suggest that the computational principles underlying language processing may indeed provide a foundation for higher-order cognition.

The Homo Codex hypothesis offers a framework for understanding the emergence of symbolic thought as a product of the gradual evolution of neural language models and their integration with other cognitive systems. This perspective highlights the critical role of language-like computations in enabling the representation and manipulation of abstract concepts, and suggests that the study of these computations may provide key insights into the origins of human cognitive uniqueness.

## 3.3 Implications for Language Evolution
The Homo Codex hypothesis has important implications for the study of language evolution and its relationship to the evolution of human cognition. By positing that the development of neural language models was a key factor in the emergence of language, the hypothesis provides a framework for integrating insights from linguistics, cognitive science, and neuroscience.

One implication of the hypothesis is that language evolution was a gradual and incremental process, rather than a sudden and dramatic event (Bickerton, 1990; Dediu & Levinson, 2018). The stage-based model proposed by the hypothesis suggests that the various components of language, such as symbolic reference, compositional semantics, and recursive syntax, emerged gradually and in a specific order, building upon pre-existing cognitive capacities. This perspective is consistent with evidence from comparative linguistics and cognitive archaeology, which suggests a long and complex history of language evolution (Tallerman & Gibson, 2012; Dediu & de Boer, 2016).

Another implication of the hypothesis is that the evolution of language was closely intertwined with the evolution of other cognitive abilities, such as social cognition, joint attention, and working memory (Tomasello, 2008). The integration of neural language models with these pre-existing cognitive systems may have been a critical step in the emergence of language, enabling the sharing of mental states and the coordination of behavior (Deacon, 1997). This perspective is supported by empirical evidence from developmental psychology and neuroscience, which highlights the role of social interaction and cognitive control in language acquisition and use (Kuhl, 2007; Fedorenko & Thompson-Schill, 2014).

The Homo Codex hypothesis also has implications for the study of language acquisition and development. If the ability to learn and generate language-like structures is a fundamental property of human neural networks, then language acquisition may be best understood as a process of tuning and refining these pre-existing computational capacities (Elman et al., 1996; Chater & Christiansen, 2010). This perspective is consistent with evidence from developmental psychology and neuroscience, which suggests that language learning builds upon domain-general mechanisms for statistical learning and pattern recognition (Saffran et al., 1996; Romberg & Saffran, 2010). Moreover, the hypothesis predicts that individual differences in language abilities may be related to variations in the structure and function of neural language models, a prediction that is supported by recent neuroimaging studies (Prat et al., 2016; Kepinska et al., 2017).

Finally, the Homo Codex hypothesis has implications for the study of language disorders and their neural basis. If language-like computations are supported by distributed networks of brain regions, then language disorders may arise from disruptions to these networks or their underlying computational mechanisms (Friederici, 2017). This perspective may help to explain the heterogeneity of language disorders and their co-occurrence with other cognitive and developmental impairments (Bishop, 2010). For example, the hypothesis predicts that disorders affecting the prefrontal cortex and its connections with language areas may lead to deficits in not only language production and comprehension but also in higher-order cognitive abilities that depend on language-like computations, such as reasoning and problem-solving (Baldo et al., 2005; Perrachione et al., 2017).

Overall, the Homo Codex hypothesis provides a unifying framework for the study of language evolution and its relationship to the evolution of human cognition. By linking insights from artificial intelligence and neuroscience with empirical evidence from linguistics, cognitive science, and archaeology, the hypothesis generates testable predictions and opens up new avenues for interdisciplinary research.

## 3.4 Cumulative Culture and the Sapient Paradox
The Homo Codex hypothesis also has important implications for understanding the emergence of cumulative culture and the origins of human cognitive uniqueness. Cumulative culture refers to the ability of human societies to accumulate and build upon cultural knowledge and innovations over generations, resulting in the development of complex technologies, social institutions, and belief systems (Boyd & Richerson, 1996; Mesoudi & Thornton, 2018). This capacity, which is unparalleled in other species, has been identified as a key factor in the ecological success and global spread of Homo sapiens (Henrich, 2015).

The Homo Codex hypothesis proposes that the development of neural language models and their integration with other cognitive systems was a prerequisite for the emergence of cumulative culture. By enabling the generation and transmission of complex, hierarchically structured information, these models provided the cognitive foundation for the accumulation and refinement of cultural knowledge (Stout & Hecht, 2017). Moreover, the ability to represent and manipulate abstract concepts, supported by language-like computations, allowed for the development of symbolic technologies, such as writing and mathematics, which greatly amplified the capacity for cultural transmission (Dehaene et al., 2015).

The emergence of cumulative culture in humans is often contrasted with the limited cultural abilities of other species, including our closest primate relatives. While many animals exhibit forms of social learning and cultural transmission, these abilities are typically restricted to simple behaviors and do not result in the accumulation of complex technologies or knowledge systems over generations (Whiten, 2017). This contrast, known as the "sapient paradox" (Renfrew, 1996), highlights the cognitive and cultural gap between humans and other species.

The Homo Codex hypothesis offers a potential resolution to the sapient paradox by identifying the computational capacities underlying human cognitive uniqueness. By positing that the development of neural language models was a key factor in the emergence of cumulative culture, the hypothesis provides a mechanistic explanation for the cognitive and cultural gap between humans and other species (Laland, 2017). This perspective is supported by empirical evidence from comparative cognition and cognitive archaeology, which suggests that the ability to process and transmit complex, hierarchically structured information was a key factor in the evolution of human cumulative culture (Stout, 2011; Osiurak & Reynaud, 2020).

For example, studies of tool use and manufacture in non-human primates have shown that while some species can learn to use simple tools through social learning, they typically do not exhibit the cumulative refinement and elaboration of tool technologies seen in human societies (Tennie et al., 2009; Osiurak et al., 2016). Similarly, the archaeological record of hominin tool use shows a gradual increase in the complexity and diversity of tool technologies over time, with the emergence of symbolic artifacts and complex technologies coinciding with the proposed development of neural language models in the Homo Codex hypothesis (Stout & Chaminade, 2012; Henshilwood & Dubreuil, 2011).

Empirical support for the role of language-like computations in cumulative culture also comes from studies of language-trained animals and individuals with language impairments. For example, studies of language-trained chimpanzees and bonobos have shown that exposure to language-like communication systems can facilitate the transmission of novel behaviors and problem-solving strategies (Savage-Rumbaugh et al., 1986; Lyn et al., 2011). Similarly, research on individuals with aphasia or developmental language disorders has shown that deficits in language processing can impair the ability to learn and transmit complex skills and knowledge (Morgan et al., 2017; Fitch et al., 2021).

Computational modeling studies have further demonstrated the potential of neural language models to support cumulative cultural evolution. For example, models trained on language-like tasks have been shown to exhibit the spontaneous emergence of compositional structure and the ability to transmit and build upon learned information over multiple generations (Kirby et al., 2014; Cogswell et al., 2019). These findings suggest that the computational principles underlying language processing may indeed provide a foundation for the accumulation and transmission of cultural knowledge.

The Homo Codex hypothesis provides a framework for integrating these diverse lines of evidence and for understanding the cognitive and cultural transitions that gave rise to human uniqueness. By emphasizing the role of language-like computations in enabling cumulative culture, the hypothesis offers a parsimonious explanation for the sapient paradox and the cognitive gap between humans and other species. Moreover, by situating these computational capacities within the broader context of hominin brain evolution and development, the hypothesis generates testable predictions and opens up new avenues for interdisciplinary research.

# 4. Empirical Evidence and Testable Predictions
## 4.1 Cognitive Archaeology and the Archaeological Record
Cognitive archaeology, the study of past human cognition through the analysis of archaeological remains, provides a rich source of empirical evidence for the Homo Codex hypothesis. By examining the material traces of past behaviors and technologies, cognitive archaeologists can infer the cognitive capacities and computational abilities of ancient hominins (Wadley, 2013; Wynn & Coolidge, 2016). The Homo Codex hypothesis generates several testable predictions about the patterns and trajectories of technological and cultural evolution in the archaeological record.

One key prediction of the hypothesis is that the emergence of language-like computations should be associated with a marked increase in the complexity and diversity of material culture. If the development of neural language models enabled the generation and transmission of more complex and structured information, then this should be reflected in the archaeological record as a proliferation of new and more sophisticated artifacts and technologies (Stout & Hecht, 2017; Sterelny, 2017). This prediction is consistent with evidence from the African Middle Stone Age and the European Upper Paleolithic, which show a rapid diversification of tool types and the emergence of symbolic artifacts, such as cave art and ornaments (McBrearty & Brooks, 2000; Bar-Yosef, 2002; Conard et al., 2009).

Another prediction of the hypothesis is that the emergence of language-like computations should be associated with an increase in the standardization and regularity of material culture. If language-like computations enabled the transmission of more precise and detailed instructions for artifact production, then this should be reflected in the archaeological record as a reduction in the variability of artifact forms and an increase in the consistency of manufacturing techniques (Hiscock, 2014; Muller et al., 2017). This prediction is supported by evidence from the Later Stone Age of Africa and the Upper Paleolithic of Europe, which show an increase in the standardization of tool forms and the emergence of highly regular and elaborate artifacts, such as bone needles and projectile points (Backwell et al., 2008; Conard et al., 2009; Stade & Conard, 2022).

The Homo Codex hypothesis also predicts that the emergence of language-like computations should be associated with an increase in the spatial and temporal scale of cultural transmission. If language-like computations enabled the transmission of more complex and abstract information across larger distances and longer time spans, then this should be reflected in the archaeological record as an increase in the geographic spread and temporal persistence of specific artifact types and technologies (Powell et al., 2009; Creanza et al., 2017). This prediction is consistent with evidence from the Upper Paleolithic of Europe, which shows the rapid spread and long-term persistence of specific artifact styles, such as the Aurignacian and Gravettian traditions (Conard & Bolus, 2003; Higham et al., 2012).

Finally, the Homo Codex hypothesis predicts that the emergence of language-like computations should be associated with an increase in the symbolic and representational content of material culture. If language-like computations enabled the generation and manipulation of abstract concepts and symbols, then this should be reflected in the archaeological record as an increase in the frequency and complexity of symbolic artifacts, such as figurines, engravings, and paintings (Henshilwood & Dubreuil, 2011; Joordens et al., 2019). This prediction is supported by evidence from the African Middle Stone Age and the European Upper Paleolithic, which show a proliferation of symbolic artifacts and the emergence of elaborate systems of visual representation, such as cave art and portable art objects (Henshilwood et al., 2002; Conard, 2009; Aubert et al., 2021).

While these archaeological patterns are consistent with the predictions of the Homo Codex hypothesis, alternative explanations for the observed changes in material culture have also been proposed. For example, some researchers have argued that the increase in technological and cultural complexity during the Late Pleistocene may have been driven by demographic factors, such as population growth and increased social interaction, rather than by cognitive changes per se (Powell et al., 2009; Derex et al., 2013). Others have suggested that environmental and climatic factors, such as the expansion of grasslands and the extinction of megafauna, may have played a role in shaping the evolution of hominin cognition and culture (Potts, 2012; Zeder, 2012).

To further test the predictions of the Homo Codex hypothesis and to distinguish between alternative explanations, future research in cognitive archaeology should focus on developing more fine-grained and quantitative analyses of the archaeological record, as well as integrating archaeological data with other lines of evidence, such as paleoenvironmental reconstructions and genetic studies of ancient hominins (Stiner & Kuhn, 2016; Douka et al., 2019). Additionally, experimental and computational modeling approaches, such as the recreation of ancient technologies and the simulation of cultural transmission processes, can provide valuable insights into the cognitive and social mechanisms underlying the patterns observed in the archaeological record (Stout et al., 2015; Mesoudi & Whiten, 2008).

Overall, the archaeological record provides a wealth of empirical evidence for the Homo Codex hypothesis and its predictions about the cognitive and cultural consequences of language-like computations. By examining the patterns and trajectories of technological and cultural evolution in the archaeological record, researchers can test the hypothesis and refine their understanding of the computational capacities underlying human cognitive uniqueness.

## 4.2 Comparative Cognition and Animal Communication
Comparative cognition, the study of cognitive processes across different species, provides another important source of empirical evidence for the Homo Codex hypothesis. By examining the communication systems and cognitive abilities of non-human animals, particularly those of our closest primate relatives, researchers can gain insights into the evolutionary precursors and uniqueness of human language and cognition (Fitch, 2010; Seyfarth & Cheney, 2014). The Homo Codex hypothesis generates several testable predictions about the similarities and differences between human and animal communication systems.

One key prediction of the hypothesis is that non-human animals, particularly primates, should exhibit some of the basic computational capacities underlying language, such as the ability to process and produce structured sequences of signals (Hauser et al., 2002; Hurford, 2012). This prediction is supported by evidence from a range of species, including songbirds, whales, and primates, which show the ability to learn and produce complex vocal sequences with hierarchical structure (Berwick et al., 2011; Suzuki et al., 2016). For example, studies of monkey alarm calls have shown that some species can combine different call types to produce more specific and informative signals, suggesting a rudimentary form of compositional communication (Arnold & Zuberbühler, 2006; Coye et al., 2016).

However, the Homo Codex hypothesis also predicts that the communication systems of non-human animals should be fundamentally limited in their expressive power and flexibility compared to human language. If the development of more advanced neural language models was a key factor in the emergence of human cognitive uniqueness, then the communication systems of other species should lack the full range of generative and combinatorial capacities that characterize human language (Townsend et al., 2018; Christiansen & Chater, 2020). This prediction is consistent with evidence from comparative studies of primate communication, which show that even the most complex forms of animal communication, such as the gestural communication of great apes, lack the open-ended productivity and recursive structure of human language (Tomasello et al., 2007; Byrne et al., 2017).

Another prediction of the hypothesis is that the cognitive abilities of non-human animals, particularly those related to social cognition and cultural learning, should be fundamentally limited compared to those of humans. If the development of language-like computations was a key factor in the emergence of cumulative culture and abstract reasoning, then the cognitive abilities of other species should be constrained by their lack of these computational capacities (Herrmann et al., 2007; Burkart et al., 2017). This prediction is supported by evidence from comparative studies of social cognition in primates, which show that while many species exhibit sophisticated social skills, such as gaze following and social learning, they lack the more advanced forms of theory of mind, joint attention, and cultural transmission that characterize human cognition (Call & Tomasello, 2008; Krupenye et al., 2019).

Empirical support for the cognitive limitations of non-human animals also comes from studies of language-trained apes and other species. While some animals, such as bonobos and parrots, have been successfully trained to use symbolic communication systems, their abilities remain limited compared to those of human children (Pepperberg, 2017; Schlenker et al., 2016). For example, language-trained apes typically do not exhibit the rapid vocabulary acquisition, grammatical competence, and creative use of language that characterize human language development (Savage-Rumbaugh et al., 1993; Lyn et al., 2011).

To further test the predictions of the Homo Codex hypothesis and to investigate the evolutionary origins of language-like computations, future research in comparative cognition should focus on developing more sophisticated experimental paradigms and computational models for studying animal communication and cognition. For example, the use of artificial grammar learning tasks and statistical learning paradigms can provide insights into the computational capacities of different species and their potential for processing complex, hierarchically structured sequences (Wilson et al., 2019; Ghirlanda et al., 2017). Additionally, the integration of comparative data with neuroanatomical and genetic studies can shed light on the neural and evolutionary mechanisms underlying the emergence of language-like computations in the hominin lineage (Rilling et al., 2008; Sousa et al., 2017).

The Homo Codex hypothesis also highlights the importance of studying the social and ecological contexts in which animal communication and cognition evolve. By examining the specific pressures and challenges faced by different species, researchers can gain insights into the adaptive functions and evolutionary origins of language-like computations (Dunbar & Shultz, 2017; Pika et al., 2018). For example, studies of social complexity and vocal communication in primates have shown that species living in larger and more complex social groups tend to have more diverse and flexible vocal repertoires (McComb & Semple, 2005; Freeberg et al., 2012), suggesting that social pressures may have played a role in the evolution of language-like abilities.

Overall, comparative cognition provides a valuable source of empirical evidence for the Homo Codex hypothesis and its predictions about the uniqueness and evolutionary origins of human language and cognition. By examining the similarities and differences between human and animal communication systems, researchers can test the hypothesis and refine their understanding of the computational capacities underlying the human mind.

## 4.3 Neuroscience and the Language Network
Neuroscience, particularly the study of language processing in the brain, provides a third important source of empirical evidence for the Homo Codex hypothesis. By examining the neural mechanisms underlying language comprehension and production, researchers can gain insights into the computational architecture of the human mind and its evolutionary origins (Fedorenko & Thompson-Schill, 2014; Friederici, 2017). The Homo Codex hypothesis generates several testable predictions about the neural basis of language processing and its relationship to other cognitive domains.

One key prediction of the hypothesis is that language processing in the brain should rely on distributed networks of regions that perform specific computational functions, rather than a single, language-specific module (Fedorenko & Thompson-Schill, 2014; Hagoort, 2019). If language-like computations emerged through the integration and adaptation of pre-existing neural systems, then language processing should recruit brain regions involved in a range of cognitive functions, such as perception, memory, and motor control (Tremblay & Dick, 2016). This prediction is supported by evidence from neuroimaging studies of language processing, which show that language comprehension and production engage a widespread network of cortical and subcortical regions, including areas traditionally associated with non-linguistic functions (Price, 2012; Hertrich et al., 2020).

Another prediction of the hypothesis is that the neural mechanisms underlying language processing should exhibit a hierarchical and compositional structure, reflecting the generative and combinatorial properties of language itself (Dehaene et al., 2015; Brennan & Martin, 2020). If the development of neural language models was a key factor in the emergence of human cognitive uniqueness, then the neural architecture of language processing should be organized in a way that supports the generation and comprehension of complex, structured sequences (Nelson et al., 2017). This prediction is consistent with evidence from neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies of language processing, which show that different levels of linguistic structure, such as phonemes, words, and sentences, are processed by distinct but interacting neural networks (Hickok & Poeppel, 2007; Ding et al., 2016).

The Homo Codex hypothesis also predicts that the neural mechanisms underlying language processing should be shaped by the specific demands of language learning and use, rather than being fully specified by genetic factors (Friederici et al., 2017; Chater et al., 2018). If the development of language-like computations was driven by specific selection pressures for more efficient communication and cultural learning, then the neural architecture of language processing should exhibit a high degree of plasticity and adaptability in response to linguistic experience (Karmiloff-Smith, 2015). This prediction is supported by evidence from developmental and cross-linguistic studies of language acquisition, which show that the neural mechanisms underlying language processing are shaped by the specific properties of the language being learned, as well as the broader cultural and social context of language use (Kuhl et al., 2006; Skeide & Friederici, 2016).

Empirical support for the plasticity and experience-dependence of the language network also comes from studies of second language learning and bilingualism. For example, neuroimaging studies have shown that the acquisition of a second language in adulthood can lead to significant changes in the structure and function of the language network, with the degree of change depending on factors such as age of acquisition, proficiency, and linguistic distance between the languages (Li et al., 2014; Pliatsikas, 2020). Similarly, studies of bilinguals have shown that the regular use of multiple languages can lead to enhanced cognitive control and flexibility, as well as changes in the neural mechanisms underlying language processing (Bialystok, 2017; Sulpizio et al., 2020).

Finally, the Homo Codex hypothesis predicts that the neural mechanisms underlying language processing should be functionally integrated with other cognitive domains, particularly those related to social cognition and cultural learning (Hagoort, 2019; Redcay et al., 2022). If the development of language-like computations was a key factor in the emergence of cumulative culture and abstract reasoning, then the neural architecture of language processing should be closely linked to brain networks involved in theory of mind, joint attention, and imitation (Whiten, 2019). This prediction is consistent with evidence from neuroimaging studies of language processing in social contexts, which show that language comprehension and production engage brain regions involved in mentalizing, empathy, and social perception (Schurz et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022).

To further test the predictions of the Homo Codex hypothesis and to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying language-like computations, future research in neuroscience should focus on developing more advanced methods for studying the structure and function of the language network, as well as its relationship to other cognitive systems. For example, the use of high-resolution neuroimaging techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging and functional near-infrared spectroscopy, can provide insights into the fine-grained connectivity and temporal dynamics of the language network (Friederici, 2017; Shalom & Poeppel, 2008). Additionally, the integration of neuroimaging data with computational modeling approaches, such as deep learning and recurrent neural networks, can shed light on the computational principles and mechanisms underlying language processing in the brain (Kriegeskorte, 2015; Schrimpf et al., 2021).

The Homo Codex hypothesis also highlights the importance of studying the development and evolution of the language network in a comparative and evolutionary framework. By examining the neural mechanisms underlying communication and social cognition in non-human primates and other species, researchers can gain insights into the evolutionary precursors and uniqueness of human language (Rilling et al., 2008; Petkov & Jarvis, 2012). For example, studies of vocal learning and control in songbirds have revealed striking parallels with the neural mechanisms underlying human speech and language, suggesting that some of the computational primitives of language may have deep evolutionary roots (Berwick & Chomsky, 2017; Jarvis, 2019).

Overall, neuroscience provides a valuable source of empirical evidence for the Homo Codex hypothesis and its predictions about the neural basis of language processing and its relationship to other cognitive domains. By examining the computational architecture and plasticity of the language network in the brain, researchers can test the hypothesis and refine their understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying human cognitive uniqueness.

# 5. Discussion
## 5.1 Limitations and Future Directions
While the Homo Codex hypothesis provides a novel and integrative framework for understanding the evolutionary origins of human language and cognition, it is not without limitations and challenges. Here, we discuss some of the key limitations of the hypothesis and outline future directions for research and theoretical development.

One limitation of the hypothesis is that it currently relies heavily on indirect evidence and theoretical arguments, rather than direct empirical tests. While the hypothesis generates a range of testable predictions, many of these remain to be systematically investigated using the full range of available methods, from cognitive archaeology and comparative cognition to neuroscience and computational modeling. Future research should focus on developing more rigorous and quantitative tests of the hypothesis, as well as on generating new data and analyses that can help to refine and extend its core claims.

Another limitation of the hypothesis is that it does not fully specify the neural mechanisms and computational principles underlying the emergence of language-like computations in the brain. While the hypothesis proposes that the development of hierarchical and compositional neural models was a key factor in the evolution of language, the exact nature and implementation of these models remains to be elucidated. Future research should aim to develop more detailed and biologically plausible models of language processing in the brain, as well as to investigate the evolutionary and developmental mechanisms that give rise to these models (Briscoe, 2017; Martin & Doumas, 2017).

A related challenge for the hypothesis is to account for the diversity and variability of human languages and cultures, both across and within societies. While the hypothesis proposes that the emergence of language-like computations was a universal and species-specific event in human evolution, it does not fully address how these computations interact with the specific linguistic, social, and ecological contexts in which they are deployed. Future research should aim to integrate the insights of the Homo Codex hypothesis with theories and data from linguistic typology, anthropology, and cultural evolution, in order to better understand the complex interplay between universal cognitive capacities and cultural particularities (Evans & Levinson, 2009; Laland, 2017).

The Homo Codex hypothesis also faces challenges from alternative theories and frameworks for understanding the evolution of language and cognition. For example, some researchers have argued that language emerged primarily as a means of facilitating social bonding and coordination, rather than as a tool for information processing and cultural transmission (Dunbar, 1998; Jaegher et al., 2016). Others have emphasized the role of gesture and multimodal communication in the evolution of language, arguing that the integration of vocal, visual, and motor systems was a key factor in the emergence of symbolic communication (McNeill, 2012; Fröhlich et al., 2019). Future research should aim to critically evaluate and compare these alternative hypotheses, as well as to explore ways in which they can be integrated or reconciled with the Homo Codex hypothesis.

Finally, the Homo Codex hypothesis raises important questions about the nature and uniqueness of human cognition, and the implications of this uniqueness for our understanding of ourselves and our place in the natural world. If the emergence of language-like computations was indeed a key factor in the evolution of human cognitive uniqueness, then this raises profound philosophical and ethical questions about the status and value of human life, as well as about our responsibilities towards other species and the planet as a whole. Future research and scholarship should aim to engage with these broader questions and implications, and to foster dialogue and collaboration across disciplines and communities.

## 5.2 Implications and Applications
Despite its limitations and challenges, the Homo Codex hypothesis has a range of important implications and applications for various fields of research and practice. Here, we discuss some of the key implications of the hypothesis for artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and education, as well as for our understanding of human nature and the future of our species.

Firstly, the Homo Codex hypothesis has important implications for the development of artificial intelligence systems that can exhibit human-like language abilities and general intelligence. If the emergence of language-like computations was indeed a key factor in the evolution of human cognition, then this suggests that incorporating similar computational principles into AI systems may be essential for achieving human-level performance on a wide range of cognitive tasks (Lake et al., 2017). This could involve developing AI architectures that exhibit hierarchical and compositional structure, as well as the ability to learn and generalize from limited data in a way that is analogous to human language acquisition (Tenenbaum et al., 2011; Marcus, 2018).

Secondly, the Homo Codex hypothesis has implications for our understanding of the cognitive architecture of the human mind, and the relationship between language and other cognitive abilities. If language-like computations are indeed a core component of human cognition, then this suggests that many aspects of perception, memory, reasoning, and social cognition may be shaped by or dependent on these computations (Lupyan & Bergen, 2016). This could lead to new approaches to studying and modeling cognitive processes in the brain, as well as to the development of novel interventions and therapies for cognitive disorders and impairments.

Thirdly, the Homo Codex hypothesis has implications for education and learning, particularly in the domain of language acquisition and development. If the ability to learn and use language is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, then this suggests that educational practices and policies should be designed to support and enhance this ability, rather than to suppress or neglect it (Kuhl, 2004). This could involve developing curricula and pedagogical approaches that are based on the principles of language acquisition and processing in the brain, as well as on the social and cultural contexts in which language is used and learned.

Finally, the Homo Codex hypothesis has broader implications for our understanding of human nature and the future of our species. If the emergence of language-like computations was a defining event in human evolution, then this suggests that language and symbolic communication are not just incidental or peripheral aspects of human life, but are instead central to who we are as a species (Deacon, 1997). This could have profound implications for how we view ourselves and our place in the world, as well as for how we approach the challenges and opportunities of the future, from the development of artificial intelligence to the preservation of linguistic and cultural diversity.

## 5.3 Conclusion
In this paper, we have introduced the Homo Codex hypothesis, which proposes that the emergence of language-like computations in the brain was a key factor in the evolution of human cognitive uniqueness. Drawing on evidence and insights from artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and comparative cognition, we have argued that the development of hierarchical and compositional neural models, analogous to modern language models, enabled the rise of symbolic thought, cumulative culture, and the distinctive cognitive abilities of Homo sapiens.

We have discussed the theoretical foundations and empirical evidence for the hypothesis, as well as its implications and applications for various fields of research and practice. We have also highlighted the limitations and challenges of the hypothesis, and outlined future directions for research and theoretical development.

Overall, the Homo Codex hypothesis offers a novel and integrative framework for understanding the evolutionary origins and computational basis of human language and cognition. While much remains to be discovered and debated, we believe that the hypothesis provides a promising avenue for future research and collaboration across disciplines, as well as for broader discussions about the nature and future of human intelligence.

As we continue to explore the mysteries of the human mind and the origins of our species, the Homo Codex hypothesis reminds us of the central role that language and symbolic communication have played in shaping who we are and who we may become. By shedding light on the computational foundations of human cognition, the hypothesis invites us to reflect on the unique and precious gift of language, and to use this gift wisely and responsibly in the pursuit of knowledge, understanding, and a better future for all.
