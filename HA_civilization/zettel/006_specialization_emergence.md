# Specialization Emergence

Hunter-gatherer: Everyone does everything.
Civilization: Everyone does one thing well.

Specialization emerges when:
- Population density allows trade
- Surplus exists to support non-food producers
- Knowledge depth exceeds individual capacity

Result: Collective capability > sum of individuals.
Cost: Individual helplessness.
