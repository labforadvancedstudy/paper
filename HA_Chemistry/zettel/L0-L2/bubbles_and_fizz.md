# Bubbles and Fizz

## Core Insight
Gas escaping liquid - chemistry making itself visible, pressure releasing, dissolved becoming free.

Shake a soda, open it - WHOOSH! Bubbles explode everywhere. Drop an antacid tablet in water - furious fizzing. Breathe out underwater - bubbles rise. Each is chemistry in motion, gases breaking free from their liquid prisons.

Carbon dioxide dissolved under pressure, suddenly released. Chemical reactions producing gas faster than liquid can hold it. The bubbles are chemistry's exclamation points - "Something's happening here!"

Children blow bubbles, fascinated by their perfect spheres, rainbow surfaces. They're seeing surface tension, watching molecules hold hands at the boundary between air and water. When bubbles pop, it's those molecular hands letting go, the film becoming too thin to hold.
