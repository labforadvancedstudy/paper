# 013 Reflexes - Fast Responses

Pre-conscious reactions. The nervous system's emergency protocols,
too important for thought delay.

## Types
- **Monosynaptic**: Direct sensory→motor (knee jerk)
- **Polysynaptic**: Through interneurons (withdrawal)
- **Supraspinal**: Brainstem mediated (pupil, balance)

## Properties
- Speed: 15-30ms response time
- Stereotyped: Same input → same output
- Modifiable: Gain control from higher centers
- Protective: Usually avoid tissue damage

## Examples
- Stretch reflex: Maintains posture
- Withdrawal: Pull away from pain
- Vestibulo-ocular: Stable vision during movement
- Startle: Whole-body protective response

## Significance
Reflexes = consciousness-free computation. Proof that complex
behavior doesn't require awareness. The unconscious competence.
