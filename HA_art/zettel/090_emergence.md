# Emergence

## Core Insight
More than the sum - where simple rules generate complex behaviors, revealing how art's meaning emerges from interactions rather than residing in components.

Emergence principles:
- Simple rules → complex outcomes
- Local interactions → global patterns
- Bottom-up organization
- Unpredictable results
- Irreducible properties

Emergent phenomena in art:
- Style from techniques
- Movements from individuals
- Meaning from materials
- Culture from practices
- Value from consensus

Levels of emergence:
- Physical (paint mixing)
- Perceptual (optical effects)
- Conceptual (meaning generation)
- Social (trend formation)
- Cultural (paradigm shifts)

Generative art emergence:
- Conway's Life patterns
- Flocking algorithms
- Reaction-diffusion
- L-systems growth
- Cellular automata

Social emergence:
- Viral phenomena
- Collective intelligence
- Swarm creativity
- Distributed authorship
- Community aesthetics

Market emergence:
- Bubble formation
- Taste convergence
- Price discovery
- Trend crystallization
- Canon formation

Emergent properties:
- Cannot predict from parts
- Cannot reduce to components
- Exist only in interaction
- Disappear when separated
- Create new levels

Scientific parallels:
- Consciousness from neurons
- Life from chemistry
- Weather from molecules
- Cities from individuals
- Ecosystems from species

Critical implications:
- Control impossible
- Authorship distributed
- Intention exceeded
- Surprise inevitable
- Wonder restored

Emergence teaches: Art more than materials plus intention. Something happens in between. Magic isn't mystical but emergent. Complexity needs no designer.
