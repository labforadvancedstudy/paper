# Abstraction (Philosophical View)

## Core Insight
Abstraction is the art of forgetting the right details at the right time.

*Note: For practical abstraction patterns and techniques, see [[002_abstraction_art]]*

Abstraction is how finite minds comprehend infinite complexity. We can't hold all the details of a modern computer in our heads, so we create layers of purposeful ignorance.

Consider driving a car. You don't think about combustion chemistry, piston timing, or gear ratios. You think "forward," "faster," "stop." The details are there, but hidden. This hiding is abstraction's gift.

In software, abstraction creates a hierarchy of lies - useful lies:
- The file system pretends storage is organized
- The operating system pretends processes are isolated
- High-level languages pretend memory is infinite
- APIs pretend complex systems are simple function calls

Each lie enables productivity by hiding complexity we don't need to see right now.

The danger: abstractions leak. When they break, you must descend into the hidden layers. The senior engineer is often just someone who knows what's behind more curtains.
