# Symbiosis Types

Life discovered: Why compete when you can merge?

Types:
- Mutualism: Win-win (flowers-bees)
- Commensalism: Win-neutral (remora-shark)
- Parasitism: Win-lose (tapeworm-host)
- All are social contracts

Mitochondria: Ancient bacterial merger.
Chloroplasts: Cyanobacteria acquisition.
Your cells = corporate mergers.

Symbiosis drives complexity jumps.
