# Wanting

## Core Insight
Desire is the engine of all economics - the gap between 'is' and 'want' creates every market.

Watch a child in a toy store. That reaching, that "I want THAT!" - this is economics being born. Wanting is more fundamental than hunger; hunger is just wanting not to hurt.

Wanting creates:
- **Value** - we want it, therefore it has worth
- **Effort** - we'll work to close the want-gap  
- **Trade** - I'll give you what you want for what I want
- **Innovation** - new ways to get what we want
- **Conflict** - when we want the same scarce thing

The Buddhist sees wanting as suffering. The economist sees it as engine. Both are right. The endless wheel of desire drives every transaction, every innovation, every economic decision.

What's remarkable: we never stop wanting. Get one thing, want another. Satisfaction is temporary; wanting is eternal. This isn't a bug - it's the feature that built civilization.

The moment a baby first points at something out of reach, economics begins.
