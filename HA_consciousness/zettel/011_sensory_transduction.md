# 011 Sensory Transduction - World to Signal

The interface between physics and perception. How reality
becomes neural code.

## Modalities → Mechanisms
- **Vision**: Photons → rhodopsin → graded potentials
- **Hearing**: Pressure waves → hair cell deflection
- **Touch**: Deformation → mechanoreceptor activation
- **Smell**: Molecules → receptor binding
- **Taste**: Chemicals → ion channel opening

## Common Principles
1. Physical energy → receptor potential
2. Amplitude → frequency coding
3. Adaptation (diminishing response)
4. Threshold detection

## Information Bottleneck
- Eyes: 10^9 bits/sec → brain processes 10^6
- Massive compression at first synapse
- What we sense ≠ what we perceive

Consciousness begins where physics meets biology.
