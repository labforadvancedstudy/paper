## Core Understanding
Technical debt is the mortgage we take on our future selves, with interest rates that would make loan sharks blush. It's the code equivalent of "I'll clean my room later," where later never comes and eventually you're living in a digital hoarder's paradise. Every shortcut is a loan, and the collector always comes calling at the worst possible time.

## Deeper Insights
- **Intentional Debt**: "We'll refactor after launch" (Narrator: They didn't)
- **Unintentional Debt**: Ignorance compounded daily
- **Interest Payments**: Every feature takes longer than the last
- **Bankruptcy**: Complete rewrite (same debt, new language)

## Technical Details
```javascript
// The archaeology of technical debt
class LegacySystem {
    constructor() {
        // Added 2008: "Temporary" solution
        this.temporarySolution = new PermanentFixture();
        
        // Added 2010: TODO: Remove after migration
        this.oldDatabase = true;  // Still here in 2024
        
        // Added 2012: Quick hack for demo
        this.demoCode = new ProductionCriticalSystem();
        
        // Added 2015: Will clean this up next sprint
        this.nextSprint = new Date('2999-12-31');
        
        // Added 2018: Don't touch - no one knows how it works
        this.mysteryFunction = () => {
            // 500 lines of spaghetti
            // Original author: quit 6 years ago
            // Documentation: "It works, don't ask"
            return magic * voodoo + prayer;
        };
        
        // Added 2020: New framework will fix everything
        this.frameworks = ['jQuery', 'Angular', 'React', 'Vue', 'Svelte'];
        this.currentFramework = 'Planning migration to Next Big Thing';
        
        // Added 2023: AI will solve this
        this.copilotGeneratedDebt = Infinity;
    }
    
    calculateDebt() {
        let debt = 0;
        
        // Time to add new feature
        debt += this.baseComplexity;
        debt *= this.yearsWithoutRefactoring ** 2;
        debt *= this.numberOfWorkarounds;
        debt *= this.developersWhoQuit;
        
        // The Seth Formula (named after that one dev)
        if (this.sethTouchedThis) {
            debt *= 10;  // Seth's code is... special
        }
        
        // Factor in organizational denial
        const managementAwareness = 0.1;
        const actualDebt = debt / managementAwareness;
        
        return {
            estimated: debt,
            actual: actualDebt,
            admitted: 0,
            timeToPay: "When we have time",
            likelihood: "lol"
        };
    }
    
    refactor() {
        throw new Error("Cannot refactor: everything depends on everything");
    }
}

// The technical debt cycle
class DebtCycle {
    constructor() {
        this.stages = [
            "Denial: 'Our codebase is fine'",
            "Anger: 'Who wrote this garbage?'",
            "Bargaining: 'Just one more hack'",
            "Depression: 'We need a full rewrite'",
            "Acceptance: 'This is our life now'",
            "Relapse: 'Just this once, we'll do it right later'"
        ];
        this.currentStage = 0;
    }
    
    progressToNextStage(newFeatureRequest) {
        this.currentStage = (this.currentStage + 1) % this.stages.length;
        console.log(`Current stage: ${this.stages[this.currentStage]}`);
        
        // Always end up back at the beginning
        if (this.currentStage === 0) {
            console.log("ðŸ”„ The cycle begins anew...");
        }
    }
}
```

## Connection to Truth
Technical debt is karma for code. Every shortcut, every "temporary" fix, every commented-out block with "TODO: fix this properly"â€”they all accumulate interest in the cosmic ledger of software entropy. It's proof that in programming, as in life, there's no such thing as a free lunch. The universe remembers every sin against good architecture.

## When It Matters
- **Always**: Debt accrues even while you sleep
- **New Features**: When "simple" changes take weeks
- **Onboarding**: When new devs cry reading your code
- **Performance**: When the house of cards starts swaying
- **Security**: When Band-Aids can't cover the wounds

## Human Element
Technical debt is the physical manifestation of human optimismâ€”we always think we'll have time to fix it later. It's procrastination crystallized in code, good intentions paved with bad implementations. Every developer has contributed to it, most deny their role, and everyone agrees someone else should fix it.
