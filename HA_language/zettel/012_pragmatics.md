# Pragmatics

## Core Insight
Meaning beyond meaning - how context transforms what words do.

## The Context Magic

"Can you pass the salt?" Literally a question about ability. Pragmatically a polite request. Pragmatics is why AI struggles with human conversation - it's not what you say, but what you mean by what you say in this situation.

Pragmatic principles:
- **Grice's Maxims**: Be relevant, truthful, clear, brief
- **Speech Acts**: Words that do things (promise, warn, marry)
- **Implicature**: What's implied but not said
- **Politeness**: Social lubrication through indirection
- **Context**: Who, where, when, why changes everything

Examples:
- "It's cold in here" → Please close the window
- "Nice haircut" (sarcastically) → Your haircut is terrible
- "We need to talk" → Bad news coming

Pragmatics is cultural:
- Americans: Direct refusal is rude
- Germans: Indirection is dishonest
- Japanese: Reading the air (kuuki yomi)
