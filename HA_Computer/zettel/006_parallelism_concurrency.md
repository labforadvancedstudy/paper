# Parallelism and Concurrency
## Core Insight
Reality doesn't compute sequentially - parallel processing is how the universe actually works.

## The Distinction

**Concurrency**: Multiple tasks progress (appearance)
- Time-slicing
- Context switching
- Interleaved execution
- One processor, many threads

**Parallelism**: Multiple tasks execute (reality)
- True simultaneity
- Multiple processors
- Genuine parallel execution
- Many processors, many threads

## Why Parallelism Matters

Sequential world:
- One thing then another
- Limited by clock speed
- Heat/power walls
- Fundamental limits reached

Parallel world:
- Everything at once
- Limited by coordination
- Scales with resources
- Matches reality's structure

## Natural Parallelism

**Physics**: Every particle updates simultaneously
**Biology**: Trillions of cells operate in parallel
**Brain**: 86 billion neurons fire together
**Society**: Millions of minds think concurrently
**Universe**: All of spacetime evolves now

Sequential is the special case.

## The Challenges

**Race conditions**: Who finishes first?
**Deadlock**: Waiting for each other forever
**Synchronization**: Coordination overhead
**Amdahl's Law**: Sequential parts limit speedup

Hard because: We think sequentially about parallel problems.
