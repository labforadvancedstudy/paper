# Exoplanet Detection

## Core Insight
Finding planets around other stars requires detecting whispers in stellar roars - tiny wobbles, minute dimming, or gravitational distortions reveal worlds we'll never directly see.

For centuries, other planetary systems were speculation. Stars are millions of times brighter than planets and astronomically distant. Direct detection seemed impossible. But clever indirect methods succeeded. The radial velocity method detects stellar wobbles from orbiting planets via Doppler shifts. Jupiter makes the Sun wobble at 13 m/s - detectable with precise spectroscopy.

The transit method watches for tiny brightness dips when planets cross their star. Earth transiting the Sun causes 0.01% dimming. Kepler space telescope monitored 150,000 stars simultaneously, finding thousands of planets. Other methods multiply: gravitational microlensing for distant planets, direct imaging for young, hot giants far from their stars, astrometry for stellar position wobbles. Each method has biases - transits favor close-in planets, radial velocity favors massive planets. Combined, they reveal planetary system diversity exceeding our wildest imagination. We've found hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, rogue planets. The universe builds planets everywhere, in configurations that would have seemed impossible.
