# Orbital Motion

## Core Insight
Everything circles everything else - the cosmic dance where falling becomes flying, where missing becomes orbiting, where separation enables eternal togetherness.

Watch the Moon cross the sky and return. Track planets through seasons. The pattern emerges: nothing travels straight in space. Everything curves, loops, returns. Orbits are falling perfected - objects falling toward each other but moving sideways fast enough to keep missing. It's failure as success, eternal near-miss as stability.

The revelation: we're all in orbit. Moon around Earth, Earth around Sun, Sun around galactic center. No fixed points, no stationary platforms, just nested circles (actually ellipses) in an infinite regression of revolution. We live on a spinning ball orbiting a nuclear furnace orbiting a black hole. Stillness is illusion; motion is truth.
