# Great Filter

## Core Insight
The Great Filter is the universe's exam that almost nobody passes - some nearly impossible step between dead matter and galaxy-spanning civilizations that explains why we see no one else.

The logic is brutal: 
- Life should be common (chemistry is universal)
- Evolution should produce intelligence (it did here)
- Intelligence should expand (resources, survival)
- We should see evidence everywhere
- We see nothing
- Therefore: Something stops almost everyone

Where's the filter? Each possibility carries different implications:

**Behind us (we're special):**
- Abiogenesis: Life starting at all
- Prokaryote to eukaryote: Complex cells
- Sexual reproduction: Genetic diversity
- Multicellularity: Cooperation at scale
- Intelligence: Brains are hard
- Technology: Tools and culture

**Ahead of us (we're doomed):**
- Nuclear self-destruction
- Climate catastrophe
- AI overthrow
- Resource depletion
- Unknown physics disaster
- Inevitable societal collapse

**At our level (the crucial moment):**
- Maybe right now is the test
- Sustainable technology vs destruction
- Planetary unity vs fragmentation
- Wisdom vs intelligence

The terrifying part: We can't know where the filter is until we're past it... or dead from it. Every technological advance might be walking toward the universe's final exam.
