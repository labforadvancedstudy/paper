# Hiring Process

## Core Insight
Hiring is organizational reproduction - the mechanism by which companies select and integrate new cells, growing through careful assimilation of external talent.

Every hire changes the company. Not just adding capacity but altering composition. Like biological systems incorporating foreign DNA, companies must balance growth with identity preservation. Too similar, no evolution. Too different, organ rejection.

The process ritualizes compatibility testing: resumes filter, interviews probe, references verify, offers negotiate. Each stage reduces uncertainty about mutual fit. It's dating for economic partnership - both sides evaluating long-term potential.

But hiring's deepest function is cultural transmission. New employees learn "how we do things here" through osmosis and instruction. They carry this cultural DNA forward, spreading and evolving it. Companies reproduce themselves through people.
