## The First Neural Networks

In cnidarians (jellyfish, sea anemones), we witness
the first true nervous systems - not centralized,
but spread like a web throughout the body.

### Architecture Without Hierarchy
- No brain, no ganglia, no center
- Every neuron connects to neighbors
- Signals propagate in all directions
- Democratic decision-making at its purest

### Emergent Behaviors
From this simple net arise:
- Coordinated swimming movements
- Prey capture sequences
- Escape responses
- The first "purposeful" actions

### The Integration Principle
The nerve net solves a fundamental problem:
How to combine multiple sensory inputs
into coherent behavioral output
without a central processor.

### Lessons for Consciousness
- Awareness doesn't require centralization
- Integration can emerge from connection
- Simple rules create complex behaviors
