# Inner Speech

The voice in your head.

Functions:
- Self-regulation
- Problem solving
- Memory rehearsal
- Self-motivation

Development:
- First: External speech
- Then: Private speech (out loud)
- Finally: Internalized

Not everyone has it.
Some think in images.
Some in abstract concepts.

Inner speech ≠ thinking.
