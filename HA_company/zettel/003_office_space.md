# Office Space

## Core Insight
The office is where individual space becomes collective space, transforming mere location into a container for organizational consciousness.

An office isn't just where work happens - it's where company happens. The walls create boundary between "us" and "not us." The desks establish territory. The conference rooms enable collision. The coffee machine creates serendipity.

Space shapes behavior. Open offices force interaction. Cubicles create privacy. Corner offices establish hierarchy. Remote work dissolves boundaries. Each spatial choice is actually an organizational choice, encoded in architecture.

The office is the company's body. Like a body, it can be healthy or sick, energizing or draining. People feel the company through its space - sterile fluorescence vs warm wood, rigid rows vs organic clusters. The space speaks before anyone opens their mouth.
