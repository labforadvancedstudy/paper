# Emergence Complexity

## Core Insight
Civilization is what happens when simple rules iterate into incomprehensible complexity - order for free.

Ants following chemical trails create highways. Neurons firing create consciousness. Humans following simple rules create civilizations no one designed or understands.

This is emergence: the whole becomes qualitatively different from its parts. A city isn't just many humans - it's a new kind of entity with its own behaviors, patterns, life cycles. It thinks thoughts no citizen thinks.

The terrifying beauty: no one's in charge. No master plan. Just local interactions creating global patterns. Civilization emerges from human interaction like consciousness emerges from neural firing - inevitable but unpredictable.
