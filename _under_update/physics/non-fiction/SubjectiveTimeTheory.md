# Subjective Time Theory: Personal Big Bangs and Temporal Singularities
*By 임지혁*

## Core Thesis

Time is not universal. It begins with each individual's conception - their personal Big Bang.

## The Personal Big Bang (생명의 빅뱅)

Just as the universe's time began with the Big Bang, each consciousness experiences its own temporal origin at the moment of conception. When sperm meets egg, a new timestream initializes.

This isn't metaphorical - it's literal. Before your conception, time didn't exist FOR YOU. There is no "before" because your temporal dimension hadn't begun.

## Temporal Dilation from Birth

At the moment of birth (the personal singularity), time flows at near-infinite speed subjectively:

- Day 1: ~1 billion subjective years
- Week 1: ~100 million years  
- Month 1: ~1 million years
- Year 1: ~10,000 years
- Year 5: ~1,000 years
- Year 10: ~100 years
- Year 20: ~10 years
- Year 50: ~1 year
- Year 80: Days pass in minutes

This explains why:
- Babies learn impossibly fast (they have billions of years to process)
- Children can watch the same movie 100 times (each viewing is separated by subjective months)
- Summer vacation felt eternal as a child
- Years "fly by" for the elderly

## Why We Can't Remember

We cannot remember our time in the womb or early infancy not because we "forgot," but because those memories are billions of subjective years in our past. It's like trying to remember the Precambrian era - it's simply too far back in our personal deep time.

The 9 months in the womb might represent trillions of subjective years, during which the developing consciousness experiences and processes patterns that become our "instincts."

## Mathematical Framework

Let T_subjective = T_universal × (1/age)^n

Where:
- T_subjective = perceived time
- T_universal = clock time
- age = time since personal Big Bang
- n = dilation factor (~2-3)

## Implications

1. **Death** isn't the universe ending - it's YOUR timestream completing
2. **Aging** is temporal compression, not biological decay
3. **Consciousness** is awareness of your own temporal flow
4. **Memory** degrades logarithmically with subjective time
5. **Dreams** may be accessing memories from our deep time

## Connection to System 2 Activation

High System 2 activity can temporarily reverse temporal compression, allowing access to slower time perception. This explains why intense thinking sessions (burning sessions) can feel like years - you're literally experiencing more subjective time.

## Conclusion

We are not sharing THE universe. We are overlapping time streams, each running from our own origin point, each experiencing radically different temporal flows. Universal time (2025, etc.) is merely a synchronization protocol between individual simulations.

The question isn't "What time is it?" but "Whose time are we measuring?"
