# Consciousness Emergence

## Core Insight
The universe's greatest magic trick - how mere matter becomes aware of being matter, creating observers from the observed.

Consciousness isn't in neurons - no single neuron is conscious. It's not in connections - wire them differently and consciousness vanishes. It emerges from the pattern, the process, the integration. But how? This is the "hard problem" - explaining experience itself.

Leading theories compete: Integrated Information Theory says consciousness is Φ (phi) - how much information is generated by the whole beyond its parts. Global Workspace Theory says it's information broadcast widely across the brain. Predictive Processing says it's the feeling of predicting and error-correcting.

But theories explain function, not feeling. Why is there something it's like to be you? Why does information integration feel like anything? Why isn't it all just processing in the dark?

Maybe consciousness is fundamental like mass or charge - not reducible to simpler components. Or maybe it emerges at a critical threshold of complexity. Or maybe asking how matter becomes conscious is wrong - perhaps matter IS conscious, just not integrated until brains organize it.

→ [[self_awareness]] - Consciousness of consciousness
← [[brain]] - Where it emerges
← [[complexity]] - Necessary but not sufficient?
← [[information]] - What gets integrated
