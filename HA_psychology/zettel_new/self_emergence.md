# Self Emergence

## Core Insight
The self isn't found in the brain - it emerges from the conversation between brain, body, and world.

Look for the self in the brain and you find only networks. No CEO neuron, no self-spot. Instead, selfhood arises from interaction: proprioception whispers "this is your body," memory insists "you were here yesterday," social mirrors reflect "this is how others see you." The self is less thing than process - a standing wave in the flow of experience. Damage any part and selfhood shifts, but never fully disappears.
