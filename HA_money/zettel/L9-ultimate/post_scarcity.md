# Post-Scarcity

## Core Insight
Post-scarcity isn't the end of economics but its transformation - when abundance makes money obsolete, new forms of value emerge around the last truly scarce resources: attention, meaning, and authentic experience.

Imagine molecular assemblers making any physical object from raw atoms. Solar panels providing unlimited energy. AI handling all necessary work. What happens to money when everything is free? This isn't fantasy - it's the logical endpoint of technological progress. 3D printing previews it. Digital goods demonstrate it. We're watching scarcity itself become scarce.

The new scarcities in abundance:
- Attention: infinite content, finite hours
- Status: positional goods can't be abundant
- Meaning: prosperity doesn't create purpose
- Authenticity: in infinite copies, originals matter more
- Time: still stubbornly linear and limited
- Experience: can't be duplicated, only lived

Post-scarcity doesn't mean post-value. It means value transforms. Maybe reputation becomes currency. Maybe gift economies return at scale. Maybe we transcend exchange entirely. The question isn't whether money survives abundance, but what humanity becomes when survival is guaranteed.
