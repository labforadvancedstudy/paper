# Economies of Scale

## Core Insight
Scale transforms economics through mathematical magic - fixed costs spread thinner, volumes negotiate harder, learning curves compound faster, making bigness its own advantage.

The first widget costs millions (R&D, tooling, setup). The millionth costs pennies (materials, labor, power). This isn't just manufacturing - it's universal law. Software scales perfectly: first user costs everything, next user costs nothing.

Scale creates gravity. Big retailers demand lower prices. Large employers attract better talent. Major platforms draw more developers. Success breeds success through pure economics. The rich get richer because scale makes them more efficient.

But scale has limits. Coordination complexity grows. Agility decreases. Culture dilutes. The same force that creates efficiency eventually creates bureaucracy. Every company must balance the economics of scale against the diseconomies of size.
