# Interferometry

## Core Insight
By combining light from multiple telescopes, interferometry creates virtual telescopes as large as their separation - achieving resolution impossible with any single instrument.

A telescope's resolution depends on its diameter - bigger mirrors see finer details. But mirrors have practical limits. Interferometry cheats: combine light from separated telescopes to simulate a giant telescope. The Very Large Telescope Interferometer combines four 8-meter telescopes across 200 meters, achieving resolution of a 200-meter telescope.

The technique requires exquisite precision. Light paths must match to nanometers. Computers correlate signals in real-time. Radio interferometry is easier (longer wavelengths), enabling continent-sized arrays. The Event Horizon Telescope linked radio dishes globally to image black hole shadows. Optical interferometry is harder but rewarding - resolving stellar surfaces, measuring stellar diameters, imaging exoplanets. Future space interferometers could image exoplanet surfaces. The principle extends beyond astronomy - gravitational wave detectors are interferometers sensing spacetime ripples. By making many telescopes work as one, we transcend individual limitations.
