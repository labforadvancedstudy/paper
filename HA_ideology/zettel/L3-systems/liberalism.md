# Liberalism

## Core Insight
The ideology of individual freedom - a worldview that makes the autonomous person the basic unit of politics and sees liberty as humanity's highest goal.

Liberalism's core tenets form an interlocking system:
- Individual rights (preceding society)
- Limited government (protecting, not directing)
- Rule of law (not rule of men)
- Market freedom (invisible hand)
- Tolerance (of different life choices)
- Progress (through reason and choice)

But liberalism contains contradictions:
- Freedom requires order (police, courts, prisons)
- Markets need regulation (to stay "free")
- Tolerance has limits (no tolerance for intolerance?)
- Individual choice assumes rational actors (are we?)
- Formal equality ignores real inequality

Liberalism shapes everything:
- Economics: free markets, private property
- Politics: democracy, rights, constitutions
- Culture: individualism, diversity, choice
- Ethics: harm principle, consent
- Knowledge: marketplace of ideas

Its success makes it invisible. Fish don't see water; we don't see liberalism. "Human rights" seem natural, not ideological. "One person, one vote" appears obvious, not revolutionary. This invisibility is liberalism's greatest triumph and deepest problem.

Critics from all sides:
- Left: liberalism masks domination
- Right: liberalism destroys tradition
- Communitarians: liberalism atomizes society
- Post-colonialists: liberalism is Western imperialism

Yet liberalism adapts, absorbs criticism, evolves. Its flexibility is its strength.
