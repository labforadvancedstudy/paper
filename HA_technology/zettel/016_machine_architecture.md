# Machine Architecture

## Core Insight
Machine architecture is frozen intention - the arrangement of components that transforms purpose into mechanism, creating physical algorithms that compute with matter.

A machine is more than its parts - it's the relationship between parts. Architecture determines behavior. Same components, different arrangement, completely different function. The architecture IS the algorithm, written in metal and motion.

Consider: engine, transmission, differential, wheels. Arranged one way: car. Differently: generator. The parts don't know their purpose; the architecture assigns it. Design is destiny crystallized in structure.

From clockwork to robots, architecture defines capability. It's the blueprint that says: "When THIS happens, THAT responds." Machine architecture is programming before computers - logic gates made of gears, conditions made of cams, loops made of linkages.
