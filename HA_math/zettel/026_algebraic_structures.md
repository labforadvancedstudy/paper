# Algebraic Structures - Rings, Fields, and Beyond

## Core Insight
Algebraic structures capture patterns of operations - revealing that addition and multiplication appear everywhere in mathematics.

## Content
Groups capture single operations. But most mathematical objects have two operations that interact. This interaction has structure.

The hierarchy builds:
- Ring: addition and multiplication (integers)
- Field: ring where division works (rationals, reals)
- Vector space: field acts on abelian group
- Algebra: vector space with multiplication

Rings are everywhere:
- ℤ: integers under +, ×
- Polynomials: R[x]
- Matrices: n×n matrices
- Functions: continuous functions on a space

Fields are special:
- Can divide (except by zero)
- Linear algebra works
- ℚ, ℝ, ℂ are fields
- Finite fields: Fₚ for prime p

The interactions matter:
- Distributivity: a(b+c) = ab + ac
- Zero annihilates: 0×a = 0
- Units can be inverted
- Ideals are absorbed by multiplication

Deep connections:
- Galois theory: field extensions encode symmetry
- Algebraic geometry: rings encode geometry
- Number theory: rings of integers
- Topology: rings of functions

Abstract algebra revealed that familiar operations are instances of universal patterns.
