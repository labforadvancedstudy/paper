# Gas Giants

## Core Insight
Jupiter and Saturn are failed stars that became Solar System sculptors - massive enough to shape everything around them but not massive enough to shine.

The gas giants are different beasts entirely from rocky worlds. Jupiter could swallow 1,300 Earths. Saturn would float in water (if you had an ocean large enough). They're mostly hydrogen and helium - star stuff that never ignited. Their cores might be rock and ice, but we'll never see them, buried under crushing atmospheres thousands of miles deep.

These giants are more than planets - they're gravitational anchors. Jupiter shields inner planets from comets, its gravity a cosmic vacuum cleaner. Saturn's rings showcase what happens when moons venture too close. Both have miniature solar systems of moons, some larger than Mercury. The gas giants show what happens when planets grow without limit - they become worlds that shape worlds, almost-stars that found a different destiny.
