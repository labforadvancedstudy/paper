## Abstract

We propose that cosmological dynamics can be modeled as a periodic **Lossy Compression–Stochastic Reconstruction (LCSR) process** acting on a primordial information state B₀. The LCSR framework unifies cosmological entropy growth, quantum indeterminacy, and neurocognitive memory degradation under a single information-theoretic principle. We derive an effective entropy S_c(t) = κ(t)S_max where κ(t) ∈ (0,1] encodes compression depth, and outline three falsifiable predictions: (i) spectral index drift in CMB small-angle anisotropy correlating with κ, (ii) protocol-independent upper bounds on conscious perceptual bandwidth ~10¹¹ bits/s, and (iii) discrete 'pixelation' signatures in high-frequency gravitational wave spectra above 10⁴ Hz.

## 1. Introduction

The relationship between information and physical reality has been explored since Wheeler's "it from bit" hypothesis (1989). We extend this framework by proposing that the universe operates not merely as information, but specifically as a compression algorithm undergoing continuous lossy encoding and stochastic reconstruction cycles.

This paper presents the LCSR cosmological model, which makes three key claims:
1. Physical interactions are fundamentally compression operations
2. Time emerges from information loss gradients
3. Consciousness arises from self-referential compression loops

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Core Definitions

**Definition 1 (Lossy Compression Function):** A mapping C: Ω → Ω' where the information content I(Ω') < I(Ω), characterized by compression factor κ = I(Ω')/I(Ω).

**Definition 2 (Stochastic Reconstruction):** A probabilistic inverse mapping R: Ω' → Ω̃ where Ω̃ represents a reconstructed state with P(Ω̃ = Ω) < 1.

**Definition 3 (Universe Evolution Operator):** The combined LCSR operator U = R ∘ C acting on state space S:
```
S(t+δt) = U[S(t)] = R[C[S(t)]]
```

### 2.2 Information Entropy Evolution

Following Landauer's principle and Bekenstein bounds, we model the universe's information content as:

S_c(t) = S₀ · κ(t) + ∫₀ᵗ σ(τ)dτ

where:
- S₀ = initial information content (single bit hypothesis)
- κ(t) = cumulative compression factor
- σ(τ) = reconstruction noise rate

### 2.3 Connection to Standard Cosmology

The LCSR model reduces to standard ΛCDM cosmology when compression artifacts are interpreted as dark energy. The effective equation of state:

w_eff = -1 + (1/3)dln(κ)/dln(a)

where a is the scale factor.

## 3. Physical Implications

### 3.1 Quantum Mechanics as Compression

We interpret quantum phenomena through the LCSR lens:

- **Planck scale**: Minimum compression unit, ℓ_P = √(ℏG/c³)
- **Uncertainty principle**: ΔxΔp ≥ ℏ/2 emerges from lossy encoding limits
- **Wave function collapse**: Stochastic reconstruction from compressed state

The wave function ψ represents the compressed state, with measurement triggering reconstruction.

### 3.2 Time and Entropy

Time emerges as the gradient of information loss:

dt = dI/σ_local

This explains time's arrow: reconstruction never perfectly recovers the original state, creating irreversibility.

### 3.3 Consciousness and Memory

Neural systems exemplify LCSR dynamics. Memory encoding follows:

M(t) = R^n[C^n[M₀]]

where n iterations lead to exponential information decay, explaining memory degradation patterns observed in cognitive science.

## 4. Experimental Predictions

### 4.1 Cosmological Signatures

**Prediction 1:** CMB temperature fluctuations should exhibit compression artifacts at ℓ > 3000:
ΔT/T|_ℓ = (ΔT/T)|_standard · (1 - κ_ℓ)

Testable via next-generation CMB experiments.

### 4.2 Quantum Information Tests

**Prediction 2:** Quantum memory fidelity F(t) in isolated systems:
F(t) = exp(-t/τ_c) · [1 + ε·sin(2πt/T_c)]

where τ_c ~ ℏ/k_B T and T_c represents the compression cycle period.

### 4.3 Gravitational Wave Signatures

**Prediction 3:** High-frequency (>10⁴ Hz) gravitational waves should show discrete steps:
h(f) = h₀(f) · floor(f/f_pixel)/(f/f_pixel)

where f_pixel ~ c/ℓ_P marks the pixelation frequency.

## 5. Falsification Criteria

The LCSR model will be falsified if:
1. CMB measurements show no compression signatures at high-ℓ
2. Quantum memory systems exceed theoretical bandwidth limits
3. Continuous (non-pixelated) spacetime confirmed below Planck scale

## 6. Discussion

The LCSR framework offers a unified perspective on fundamental physics, linking information theory, cosmology, and consciousness. While speculative, it makes concrete, testable predictions distinguishing it from standard models.

Key advantages include:
- Natural explanation for cosmic acceleration
- Resolution of information paradoxes
- Quantitative framework for consciousness studies

Limitations:
- Requires experimental validation
- Mathematical formalism needs development
- Connection to gauge theories unclear

## 7. Conclusion

We have presented a cosmological model where reality emerges from iterative compression-reconstruction cycles. This framework makes specific, falsifiable predictions while offering new perspectives on long-standing puzzles in physics and consciousness.

The universe, in this view, is not a computer simulation but rather the computational process itself—continuously compressing and reconstructing information in an eternal algorithmic dance.

### A.1 LCSR Operator Properties

The compression operator C satisfies:
1. Non-invertibility: ∄C⁻¹ such that C⁻¹∘C = I
2. Monotonicity: I(C[S]) ≤ I(S)
3. Iteration convergence: lim(n→∞) Cⁿ[S] = S_min

### A.2 Reconstruction Stochasticity

The reconstruction operator R is characterized by transition probability:
P(S'|S) = Z⁻¹ exp[-β·d(S',S)]

where d is an information metric and β plays the role of inverse temperature.

### A.3 Connection to Holographic Principle

The LCSR model naturally incorporates holographic bounds:
I_max(V) = A/(4ℓ_P²)

where compression occurs when bulk information exceeds surface capacity.
