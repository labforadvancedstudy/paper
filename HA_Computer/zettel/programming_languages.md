# Programming Languages

## Core Insight
Human thoughts translated into crystal clarity - bridges between minds and machines.

Machine code is hostile to humans. Just numbers. Programming languages are peace treaties, letting us think in something closer to thought while machines execute in something closer to electrons. Each language is a different philosophy about how humans should talk to computers.

C says "let me touch the metal." Python says "handle the details for me." Lisp says "code is data is code." Each language shapes what's easy to think, what's hard to express. They're not just tools - they're lenses that refract thought into computation.
