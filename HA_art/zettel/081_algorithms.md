# Algorithms

## Core Insight
Instructions becoming form - where step-by-step procedures generate infinite variations, revealing how rules create freedom and constraint simultaneously shapes possibility.

Algorithm types in art:
- Generative (creating forms)
- Analytical (processing data)
- Interactive (responding)
- Evolutionary (mutating)
- Machine learning (pattern finding)

Historical precedents:
- Sol LeWitt instructions
- Cage chance operations
- Oulipo constraints
- Islamic geometry
- Fugue structures

Algorithmic thinking:
- Rules defined
- Parameters set
- Randomness included
- Iteration enabled
- Emergence expected

Contemporary practices:
- Processing sketches
- Neural style transfer
- GAN generation
- Blockchain protocols
- Live coding

Algorithm aesthetics:
- Complexity from simplicity
- Pattern recognition
- Glitch embraced
- Variation celebrated
- Process visible

Critical questions:
- Author: human or machine?
- Creativity location?
- Bias embedded?
- Black box problem?
- Control illusion?

Benefits discovered:
- Inhuman beauty
- Massive scale
- Real-time generation
- Collaborative potential
- Surprise guaranteed

Challenges faced:
- Technical barriers
- Aesthetic sameness
- Market confusion
- Documentation difficulty
- Preservation complexity

Future directions:
- AI collaboration
- Quantum algorithms
- Biological computing
- Hybrid systems
- Unknown unknowns

Algorithm as metaphor: All art algorithmic. Traditional painting follows muscle memory algorithms. Culture itself algorithmic patterns. Recognizing algorithms everywhere changes seeing.
