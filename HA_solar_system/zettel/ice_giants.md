# Ice Giants

## Core Insight
Uranus and Neptune are the Solar System's forgotten giants - smaller, denser, and stranger than their gas giant siblings, holding secrets about planetary formation in their frozen hearts.

The ice giants are misnamed - they're not ice but compressed gases and "ices" (water, methane, ammonia) under extreme pressure. Uranus rolls on its side, possibly knocked over by a massive impact. Neptune radiates more heat than it receives, powered by some internal energy source. Both have bizarre magnetic fields, tilted and offset from their rotation axes, suggesting interior structures we don't understand.

These worlds challenge planetary formation theories. Too far out to gather much hydrogen before the solar nebula dissipated, too massive to be just rock and ice. They likely formed closer to the Sun and migrated outward, or formed from different mechanisms entirely. The ice giants remind us that even in our own Solar System, mystery worlds await. We've visited them only once each, briefly, leaving more questions than answers.
