# Variables and the Algebra of Unknowns

## Core Insight
Variables are mathematics' pronouns - symbols that stand for something without being that something.

## Content
When we write "x", we perform a magic trick: we manipulate what we don't know to discover what we must know. This is algebra's gift - reasoning about the unknown as if it were known.

The journey from arithmetic to algebra:
- 3 + __ = 7 (fill in the blank)
- 3 + ? = 7 (question mark as placeholder)
- 3 + x = 7 (letter as variable)
- ax + b = c (general form)

Variables aren't just unknowns - they're:
- Placeholders: "Let x be any real number"
- Parameters: "For all values of a"
- Functions' inputs: "f(x) = x²"
- Bound by quantifiers: "∃x such that..."

The power isn't in finding x - it's in manipulating expressions without knowing x. We can prove that (x + y)² = x² + 2xy + y² without ever knowing what x or y are. The pattern holds for all values.

This abstraction enables:
- Solving equations systematically
- Expressing general relationships
- Building functions
- Creating mathematical proofs

Variables turned mathematics from calculating specific answers to discovering universal truths.
