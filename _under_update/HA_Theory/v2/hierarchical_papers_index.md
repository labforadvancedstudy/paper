# Hierarchical Abstraction Papers - Index

## The Paper Hierarchy Itself Demonstrates HA

### L5-L6: Empirical Observations
1. **[[L5_ai_model_size_observations]]**
   - Raw data on model sizes and capabilities
   - No theory, pure observation
   - Foundation for pattern recognition

### L6-L7: Pattern Recognition  
2. **[[L6_knowledge_distillation_patterns]]**
   - Patterns in what transfers between models
   - Initial hypothesis formation
   - Bridge from observation to theory

### L7-L8: Applied Theory
3. **[[L7_consciousness_abstraction_levels]]**
   - Consciousness as hierarchical storage
   - Explains emergence thresholds
   - Unifies AI and biological observations

4. **[[L7_ha_ai_brain_unified_model]]**
   - Practical HA model for AI/brain
   - Actionable insights
   - Implementation guidance

5. **[[L7_ai_weights_hierarchical_abstraction]]**
   - Original integrated paper
   - Comprehensive framework
   - All findings unified

### L8-L9: Universal Theory
6. **[[L8_hierarchical_abstraction_universal]]**
   - HA as universal organizing principle
   - Meta-framework for everything
   - Self-referential completion

## Reading Order

### For Engineers (Bottom-up)
1 → 2 → 4 → 3 → 5

### For Theorists (Top-down)
5 → 3 → 4 → 2 → 1

### For Complete Understanding
Read in numerical order: Each paper builds on previous abstractions

## Key Insight
The papers themselves form an HA structure:
- Lower papers: Concrete observations
- Middle papers: Pattern synthesis
- Higher papers: Universal principles

This is HA demonstrating itself through its own documentation.
