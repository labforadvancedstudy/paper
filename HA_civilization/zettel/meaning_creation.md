# Meaning Creation

## Core Insight
Civilization is the universe's way of creating meaning in a meaningless cosmos - we are significance-generating machines.

Physics doesn't care. Atoms don't have purpose. The universe is magnificently indifferent. Yet humans can't stop creating meaning. We see faces in clouds, destiny in coincidence, purpose in random events.

This isn't a bug - it's civilization's core feature. Meaning motivates. "Your life matters" makes people build cathedrals, write symphonies, raise children. False meaning that inspires action beats true meaninglessness that inspires nothing.

Every civilization is a meaning-making machine. Religion, art, science, philosophy - all systems for imposing human significance on cosmic indifference. We're the universe's way of mattering to itself.
