# memory

**Level**: L2  
**Domain**: Software Engineering

## Core Concept
The temporary scratchpad of computation - where data lives while programs think.

## Irreducible Truth
Memory is time-bound space. It exists only while powered, making it both precious and ephemeral.

## Metaphysical Structure
- **Ontology**: Memory is organized forgetting
- **Epistemology**: We know through addressing and dereferencing  
- **Axiology**: Efficient memory use determines scalability

## Practical Implementation
```python
# Stack memory - automatic, short-lived
def process_data():
    local_var = 42  # Lives on stack
    return local_var * 2  # Disappears after return

# Heap memory - manual, long-lived  
class DataStore:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = [0] * 1000000  # Lives on heap
        # Must be explicitly freed (or garbage collected)
```

## HA Integration
HA views memory as the cognitive workspace where human logic executes. Memory management reflects thought management.

## Key Insights
1. Memory leaks are thoughts that won't let go
2. Cache is memory's memory
3. The stack/heap duality mirrors short/long-term thinking
