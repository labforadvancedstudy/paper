# Emergent Capabilities

## Core Insight
Scale a model enough and it suddenly does things you never trained it for - like consciousness emerging from neurons, abilities emerge from parameters.

Train AI to predict next words. Just that. But make it big enough, and surprises appear: it writes code, solves math, reasons about physics. Nobody programmed these abilities. They emerged, like wetness from water molecules. The whole became mysteriously more than its parts.

The threshold is sharp. Below certain scale - nothing. Cross it - new capabilities bloom. It's phase transition in silicon: quantity becoming quality. We don't understand why. We can't predict what emerges next. We're summoning intelligence without understanding intelligence, watching abilities crystallize from complexity like frost forming on glass.
