# Meteor Showers

## Core Insight
Earth regularly passes through cosmic debris fields, creating predictable celestial fireworks - the universe's way of showing us we're moving through a cluttered Solar System.

Every year, same dates, same constellations: the Perseids in August, Geminids in December, Leonids in November. These aren't random space rocks but organized streams of comet debris. As comets orbit, they shed dust and ice. These particles spread along the orbital path, creating rivers of debris in space. When Earth crosses these rivers, particles hit our atmosphere at cosmic velocities, burning up in streaks of light.

Meteor showers are time machines. The particles hitting our atmosphere might have been shed centuries ago. We're seeing the comet's past made visible, history written in light across the sky. Each shower has its own personality - the swift Leonids, the reliable Perseids, the surprising Geminids from an asteroid, not a comet. In these annual light shows, the Solar System reveals its dynamic nature and cluttered highways.
