# Inflation

## Core Insight
Money's slow death: when the measuring stick shrinks, making numbers lie about value - the hidden tax on existence.

Inflation is money losing its memory. What cost $1 yesterday costs $1.10 today. The numbers grow but the value stays same - or shrinks. It's economics' version of entropy.

Inflation causes:
- **Money printing** - more dollars chasing same goods
- **Demand surge** - too many wanting too few
- **Supply shock** - suddenly less available
- **Expectations** - believing prices will rise
- **Wage-price spiral** - each pushing other up

Inflation effects:
- Savings erode (money under mattress dies)
- Debt shrinks (borrow in strong money, repay in weak)
- Price signals blur (is it really more valuable?)
- Planning hardness (what will things cost?)
- Social tension (wages lag prices)

The strange truth: moderate inflation is desired. It forces money to work rather than hide. It makes debt manageable. It allows quiet wage adjustments. 

Too much inflation destroys economies. Too little freezes them. The Goldilocks challenge: just right is ~2% yearly. A slow burn that keeps money moving.
