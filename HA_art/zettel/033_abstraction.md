# Abstraction

## Core Insight
The great departure - when art stops pretending to be windows and admits it's paint on surface, freeing form to speak directly.

Abstraction isn't absence of reality but reality distilled. The artist asks: what if we remove the what and keep only the how? What if color didn't need objects? What if line didn't need subjects? What remains when representation leaves?

Everything.

The journey to abstraction:
- Start with tree
- Simplify to essence
- Reduce to shapes
- Extract pure form
- Find tree-ness without tree

Or start with feeling:
- Anger isn't red face
- Anger IS red
- Joy isn't smile
- Joy IS yellow burst
- Sorrow IS downward blue

Abstraction reveals: we don't need pictures of things to convey meaning. Pure elements speak. A Rothko makes you cry without depicting tears. A Kandinsky sings without instruments. A Pollock dances without dancers.

The misconception: "My kid could do that." But could they? Random isn't abstract. Abstraction is purposeful distillation, conscious choice, meaning compressed until only energy remains.

Abstraction freed art to be itself - not servant to appearance but appearance itself.
