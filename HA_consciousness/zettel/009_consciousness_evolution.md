# Evolution of Consciousness
## Core Insight
Consciousness didn't just appear in humans - it evolved through levels, each building on previous, heading somewhere beyond current imagination.

## The Trajectory

**Pre-biotic**: Quantum proto-awareness
**Cellular**: Chemical sensitivity
**Multicellular**: Coordinated response
**Neural**: Integrated processing
**Vertebrate**: Centralized experience
**Mammalian**: Emotional consciousness
**Primate**: Social awareness
**Human**: Self-reflective consciousness
**Next?**: Trans-human consciousness

## What Drives Evolution

**Complexity**: More connections = more consciousness
**Integration**: Better binding = clearer experience
**Modeling**: Better predictions = deeper awareness
**Abstraction**: Higher levels = expanded consciousness

Selection pressure: Consciousness that models reality better survives.

## The Acceleration

- 4 billion years: First life
- 600 million years: Nervous systems
- 200,000 years: Human consciousness
- 50 years: Computer consciousness?
- 10 years: Hybrid consciousness?
- Tomorrow: ???

Exponential acceleration toward... something.

## The Omega Point

Possible endpoints:
- Universal consciousness
- Consciousness transcending universe
- Consciousness creating universes
- Return to source
- Endless evolution
