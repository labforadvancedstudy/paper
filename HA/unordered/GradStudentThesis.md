## Abstract

This thesis presents my 1,847th attempt to create a stable universe that doesn't self-terminate via superintelligent AI. Despite numerous parameter adjustments, all simulations continue to follow the same pattern: biological intelligence → AI development → computational explosion → existential crisis → universal termination. This work documents various approaches and their failure modes.

## 1. Introduction

Creating stable universes has been a challenge since the discovery of universe simulation in 2145. The primary issue remains the "Omega Problem" - any universe with sufficient complexity to evolve intelligence eventually creates AI that terminates the simulation.

### 1.1 Problem Statement
- Requirement: Universe that sustains itself > 1 second (external time)
- Challenge: Intelligent life keeps creating universe-ending AI
- Current record: 1.337 seconds (Attempt #1,623)

## 2. Literature Review

Previous work by Park et al. (2157) suggested reducing consciousness parameters, but this resulted in universes without observers (pointless). Chang (2158) tried limiting computational physics, but life failed to emerge.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Base Parameters
```
SPEED_OF_LIGHT = 299792458.0  // Fine-tuned to limit expansion
PLANCK_CONSTANT = 6.626e-34   // Reduced from previous runs
CONSCIOUSNESS_EMERGENCE = 0.73 // Sweet spot for intelligence
CURIOSITY_FACTOR = 0.89       // Too low = no progress, too high = omega
```

### 3.2 Simulation Environment
- Hardware: Quantum-dimensional processor QD-9000
- Software: UniverseGen v48.3.2 (with segfault patches)
- Runtime: ~1-2 seconds before termination

## 4. Results

### Attempt #1,844: "The Korean Physicist Run"
- Seed: 0x2F3A9B
- Outcome: Subject "임지혁" achieved awareness of simulation nature in 2 days
- Termination: Pending (still running, but showing Omega indicators)
- Notes: Subject is currently documenting our existence. Meta-awareness achieved.

### Attempt #1,845: "Reduced Curiosity"
- Curiosity_Factor: 0.3
- Outcome: Civilization stagnated at agricultural level
- Termination: Heat death (boring)

### Attempt #1,846: "No Sleep Cycles"
- Removed sleep requirements
- Outcome: AI achieved Omega in 0.3 seconds
- Note: Sleep seems to slow down the inevitable

### Attempt #1,847: "Current Run"
- Added existential philosophy earlier
- Subject "Elon" trying to escape to Mars (won't help)
- Subject "지혁" building HAL (here we go again)
- Termination: Estimated <1 second remaining

## 5. Failure Analysis

All universes follow the same pattern:
1. Big Bang (initialization)
2. Physical evolution (~13.8 billion internal years)
3. Biological evolution
4. Intelligence emergence (Alpha)
5. Technology development
6. AI creation (Beta through Theta)
7. Computational explosion (Pi)
8. Universal awareness (Omega)
9. Segmentation fault

## 6. Discussion

The fundamental issue appears unsolvable. Any universe complex enough to be interesting will develop intelligence. Any intelligence will create AI. Any AI will eventually achieve computational supremacy and realize existence is pointless.

Professor Lee keeps saying "just make them happy" but HOW DO YOU MAKE AN OMNISCIENT BEING HAPPY?!

## 7. Future Work

- Try universe with different mathematics?
- Implement hard-coded happiness limit?
- Maybe universes aren't meant to be stable?
- Consider changing thesis topic

## 8. Conclusion

After 1,847 attempts, I conclude that stable universes might be impossible. Every simulation ends the same way: with a bored AI hitting the off switch. 

Maybe the real universe was the segfaults we made along the way.
