# Government

## Core Insight  
The machinery of collective decision - the institutional apparatus that transforms political will into social reality through bureaucracy, procedure, and force.

Government is how the state touches daily life. While the state is abstract sovereignty, government is concrete administration: the offices, officers, forms, and functions that make collective decisions and implement them.

Government consists of:
- Decision makers (executives, legislators, judges)
- Implementers (bureaucrats, administrators)
- Enforcers (police, military, inspectors)
- Processes (elections, appointments, procedures)
- Outputs (laws, policies, services)

The eternal tensions:
- Efficiency vs accountability
- Expertise vs democracy  
- Centralization vs local control
- Stability vs responsiveness
- Secrecy vs transparency

Government faces an impossible task: making collective decisions for millions with different interests, values, and desires. Every structure is a compromise, every process a trade-off.

The paradox: we need government because we can't agree, but government requires enough agreement to function. Too little agreement and government collapses into paralysis or civil war. Too much and it becomes tyranny.

Modern government is staggeringly complex - millions of employees, thousands of agencies, endless procedures. This complexity is both bug and feature: it frustrates citizens but also prevents any single person or group from seizing total control.
