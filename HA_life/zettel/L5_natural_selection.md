# Natural Selection

## Core Insight
The only known process that creates the illusion of design without a designer - a blind algorithm that sculpts complexity from chaos using only death and time.

Darwin's dangerous idea is beautifully simple: things that are better at making copies of themselves make more copies of themselves. That's it. No foresight, no goal, no purpose. Just differential reproduction. Yet from this simple rule emerges all the complexity of life.

Three ingredients: variation (things differ), heredity (offspring resemble parents), and selection (some survive better). Mix, wait, repeat. Given enough time, this recipe can cook up anything from bacteria to brains. No chef required.

It's an algorithm, not a force. It doesn't push or pull - it just counts. Who had more grandchildren? They win. Their traits increase in frequency. The environment doesn't select - it just sets the rules of the game. Life plays against itself.

The cruelty and beauty: it works by failure. Every adaptation is built on a mountain of corpses - the ones that didn't make it. Evolution doesn't find the best solution, just one that works well enough to beat the competition. We are the descendants of an unbroken chain of winners in a game where most players die.
