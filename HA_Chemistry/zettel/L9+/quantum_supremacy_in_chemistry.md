# Quantum Supremacy in Chemistry

## Core Insight
Some chemical systems might require quantum computers to simulate - chemistry could be the killer app for quantum computation.

Classical computers hit exponential walls simulating quantum systems. Each additional electron doubles computational requirements. Protein folding, drug design, catalyst optimization push beyond classical limits. Nature solves these effortlessly - proteins fold in microseconds.

Quantum computers could simulate chemistry naturally - qubits mimicking electron quantum states. Recent demonstrations show quantum advantage for molecular simulation. The crossover point approaches where quantum beats classical for real chemical problems.

But there's deeper intrigue: does chemistry itself compute quantumly? Do enzymes exploit quantum coherence? Does photosynthesis use quantum walks? If so, life discovered quantum computation billions of years before us. We're just catching up to bacteria.
