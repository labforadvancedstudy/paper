# Engineering Wisdom
## Core Insight
Software engineering wisdom comes from understanding that code is easy, systems are hard, and people are hardest.

## Hard-Won Truths

**Premature optimization is evil**
But performance ignored is debt

**Simple is better than clever**
But simple is hardest to achieve

**Working software over perfect**
But quality enables speed

**People over process**
But process enables people

Balance in everything.

## The Paradoxes

**More features = less usable**
**More abstraction = less flexible**
**More testing = slower delivery (short term)**
**More documentation = less accurate**
**More developers = slower progress (initially)**

Wisdom navigates paradox.

## What Experience Teaches

**Estimates are always wrong**
Plan for uncertainty

**Requirements will change**
Design for change

**Bugs are normal**
Systems for resilience

**Teams are everything**
Invest in people

**Learning never stops**
Stay humble

## The Meta-Skills

Beyond coding:
- **Communication**: Ideas matter only if shared
- **Empathy**: Understand users and teammates
- **Systems thinking**: See whole not parts
- **Learning**: Technology changes, principles remain
- **Judgment**: Know when to break rules

## The Final Wisdom

Software engineering is:
- 10% writing code
- 30% reading code
- 30% debugging
- 30% people

The 10% is easiest part.
