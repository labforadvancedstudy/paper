# Symmetry and Chemistry

## Core Insight
Symmetry determines chemical properties - selection rules, spectroscopy, reactivity all flow from molecular symmetry operations.

Molecules have symmetry elements: rotation axes, mirror planes, inversion centers. Water has C2v symmetry - twofold rotation, two mirror planes. These aren't just geometric curiosities - they dictate everything.

Group theory formalizes this. Each symmetry operation is a mathematical transformation. Together they form groups with specific properties. Irreducible representations of these groups determine which transitions are allowed, which orbitals can mix, which vibrations are IR active.

Conservation laws link to symmetries via Noether's theorem. Spatial symmetry gives momentum conservation, temporal gives energy conservation. In molecules, symmetry gives selection rules. Symmetry forbidden transitions can't happen (except they do, weakly, when symmetry breaks).
