# ATP

## Core Insight
Life's universal currency - the only denomination accepted by every molecular transaction in every cell.

ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is life's brilliant solution to energy accounting. Instead of each reaction finding its own energy source, everything runs on one currency: ATP → ADP + energy.

The numbers are staggering. You have about 250g of ATP right now, but you'll use 40kg today. That means each ATP molecule is recycled 160 times daily. It's like having $5 but spending $1000 by reusing each dollar 200 times.

The molecule itself is elegant: adenine (a DNA base) + ribose (a sugar) + three phosphates. Breaking the third phosphate releases energy. Adding it back stores energy. Simple as a spring being compressed and released.

But here's the genius: ATP is unstable. It wants to lose that third phosphate. This instability IS the usefulness - stored energy ready to release. Too stable = useless. Too unstable = explosive. ATP sits perfectly in the "eager but patient" zone.
