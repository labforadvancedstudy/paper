# Space

## Core Insight
The territory between and around - space isn't emptiness but active partner in composition, the silence that makes sound meaningful.

Space divides into:
- Positive space: the objects, figures, marks
- Negative space: the "empty" areas around
- Shallow space: compressed depth
- Deep space: vast recession
- Ambiguous space: unclear relationships

But "negative" misleads - space is never passive. It:
- Defines objects (silhouette)
- Creates rhythm (intervals)
- Guides eye movement (pathways)
- Establishes mood (crowded vs. open)
- Carries meaning (isolation, freedom)

Eastern art understood space first. Ma (間) in Japanese - the pregnant emptiness. Chinese painting's vast voids. They knew: space breathes life into form. Western art took centuries to learn this, filling every inch until modernism rediscovered emptiness.

Artists manipulate space through:
- Overlap (near over far)
- Size variation (big = close)
- Placement (high = distant)
- Detail reduction (atmospheric perspective)
- Linear perspective (mathematical space)
- Color temperature (cool recedes)

Digital space differs. Infinite canvas. Layers. Z-axis. Undo means space is never committed. This freedom paralyzed some artists - constraints inspire creativity.

Installation art made space the medium. Not objects in space but space itself shaped, activated, experienced. Viewers move through artwork, becoming part of spatial composition.
