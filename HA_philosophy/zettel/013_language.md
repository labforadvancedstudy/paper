# Language

## Core Insight
The house of being - we don't speak language, language speaks us.

## The Prison We Built

Wittgenstein's ladder: language creates the limits of our world. We can't think outside its boundaries because thought itself is linguistic.

L1: Grunt, point, name
L2: Sacred words create reality
L3: Words mirror things
L4: Language maps thought
L5: Language shapes thought
L6: Language is the game
L7: Language is power
L8: Language is code
L9: Language dissolves into pattern

The recursive trap: using language to analyze language is like trying to bite your own teeth.
