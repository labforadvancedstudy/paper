# Quantum Computing

## Core Insight
Computation using reality's cheat codes - calculating with possibilities instead of certainties.

Classical bits must choose: 0 or 1. Qubits refuse: 0 and 1 simultaneously. Superposition lets quantum computers explore all paths at once, like solving a maze by walking through walls. Entanglement creates spooky connections where measuring one qubit instantly affects another.

This isn't faster classical computing - it's different computing. Problems that would take classical computers universe-lifetimes become tractable. We're not improving calculation; we're discovering that the universe calculates in ways we're just beginning to steal.
