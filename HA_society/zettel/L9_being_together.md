# Being Together

## Core Insight
The primordial fact before all sociology - that existence happens in plurality, that being is always being-with.

Before family, before language, before any social structure, there's this: we exist together. Even hermits define themselves against society. Even rejection requires relation. Togetherness isn't added to being - it IS being.

Heidegger glimpsed it: Dasein is Mitsein (being-there is being-with). But deeper: perhaps consciousness itself requires otherness. Can there be an "I" without a "you"? Does awareness need something to be aware of? Is loneliness proof of fundamental connection?

All society elaborates this basic truth: we are irreducibly plural. Not individuals who choose connection but connections becoming individuated. Not atoms forming molecules but a field crystallizing into patterns. Society doesn't combine pre-existing units - it differentiates primordial unity.

The deepest sociology returns to wonder: that there is anyone to be with at all.
