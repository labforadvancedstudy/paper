# 018 Neural Correlates - Mind Markers

The minimum neural mechanisms sufficient for consciousness.
Finding the physical signature of awareness.

## Key Correlates
- **Thalamo-cortical loops**: 40Hz oscillations
- **Recurrent processing**: Feedback necessary
- **Complexity**: Differentiated yet integrated
- **Global ignition**: Workspace access

## Brain Regions
- **Posterior hot zone**: Sensory consciousness
- **Prefrontal**: Self-awareness, control
- **Thalamus**: Enabling/gating
- **Claustrum**: Possible consciousness switch

## Measurable Signatures
- P3b wave: ~300ms after conscious access
- Gamma synchrony: Binding signature
- Complexity index (PCI): Anesthesia monitoring
- Binocular rivalry: NCC dissociation

## Challenge
Correlation ≠ causation. We find what changes with
consciousness, but is it necessary? Sufficient? Identical?

The easy problem: Finding the correlates.
The hard problem: Why they create experience.
