# Food Webs

## Core Insight
Everyone is someone's lunch - the economy of energy flowing through life in endless transactions.

A food chain is too simple. Real ecosystems are webs - tangles of who-eats-whom that would make corporate org charts weep. The hawk eats the mouse eats the seed. But the hawk also eats snakes that eat mice, and birds that compete with mice for seeds. When the hawk dies, bacteria eat it, fertilizing plants that make seeds.

Energy enters through plants (or chemosynthetic bacteria), flows through herbivores to carnivores to decomposers, losing 90% at each step to heat. This inefficiency shapes everything - why big fierce animals are rare, why there are more ants than elephants.

Remove one species and the web flexes, compensates, or collapses. Sea otters vanish? Sea urchins explode, kelp forests die, entire coastlines erode. Wolves return to Yellowstone? Rivers literally change course as vegetation patterns shift.

We've discovered that "pest" and "predator" are human labels on a deeper truth: everything is food for something, and everything needs food from something. The web has no heroes or villains, just energy seeking the most efficient path through life.
