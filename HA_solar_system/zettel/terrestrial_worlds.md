# Terrestrial Worlds

## Core Insight
The inner Solar System's rocky planets are siblings separated at birth - same basic ingredients, radically different fates, teaching us that location and size determine destiny.

Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars - four rocky worlds, four different stories. Mercury: scorched and airless, a fossil world. Venus: Earth's twin gone wrong, crushed under greenhouse hell. Earth: the Goldilocks planet where everything went right. Mars: the planet that almost made it, now a frozen desert dreaming of its wet past.

They started similar - rock and metal accreted from the inner disk. But small differences cascaded. Mercury couldn't hold atmosphere. Venus couldn't lose it. Mars couldn't keep it. Only Earth found the balance: large enough to retain air and water, far enough for liquid water, close enough for warmth. The terrestrial worlds show how narrow the parameters for habitability are, how lucky Earth is, how un-special yet unique our home world remains.
