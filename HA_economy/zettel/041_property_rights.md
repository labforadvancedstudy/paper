# Property Rights

## Core Insight
The foundation of all economics: defining who owns what and what ownership means - turning possession into law.

Property rights are the rules that transform "mine" from a toddler's cry into enforceable claim. They define what can be owned, who can own it, and what owners can do. Without property rights, there's no economy - only grabbing.

Property rights bundle:
- **Use rights** - I can utilize it
- **Exclusion rights** - I can keep others out
- **Transfer rights** - I can sell/gift it
- **Modification rights** - I can change it
- **Destruction rights** - I can eliminate it

Types evolve with society:
- Physical property (land, objects)
- Intellectual property (ideas, creations)
- Digital property (data, virtual goods)
- Rights to rights (options, futures)
- Emerging rights (carbon, spectrum)

The profound shift: property rights create property. Land becomes "real estate," ideas become "patents," labor becomes "human capital." Rights transform physics into economics.

Yet every system answers differently: What's ownable? Who enforces? How much is too much? Property rights are where philosophy meets force.
