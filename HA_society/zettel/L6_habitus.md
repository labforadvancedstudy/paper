# Habitus

## Core Insight
Society inscribed in bodies - how social structures become personal instincts, making culture feel like nature.

Bourdieu's breakthrough: we don't just learn society's rules, we embody them. A working-class person doesn't choose to feel uncomfortable in an opera house - their body rebels. An upper-class person doesn't decide to hold wine glasses correctly - their fingers know.

Habitus is history turned into nature. Generations of class position create postures, tastes, ways of speaking that feel personal but reveal social origins. You can change your income but your habitus whispers where you came from.

This explains social reproduction without conspiracy. Rich kids succeed not (just) through money but through inherited ease in elite spaces. Meritocracy measures what it produced: people shaped to succeed in existing systems.
