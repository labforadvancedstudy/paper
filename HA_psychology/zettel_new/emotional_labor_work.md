# Emotional Labor: Feeling Work

**Core Concept**: Managing your emotions to meet social or job requirements is exhausting work.

## One-Line Definition
Smiling when you want to scream is labor - it depletes mental resources like physical work depletes muscles.

## Simple Mental Model
Like holding a fake smile in a photo for too long - what seems effortless becomes painful. Now imagine eight hours daily.

## Key Mechanism
1. Feel authentic emotion
2. Display required emotion
3. Emotional dissonance creates stress
4. Sustained effort causes burnout

## Practical Example
Flight attendant dealing with rude passenger: feels anger, displays warmth. Cashier with personal crisis: feels sadness, displays cheer. The gap between felt and shown exhausts.

## Common Misconception
Emotional labor is just being nice. Actually, it's the effortful management of emotions - forced cheerfulness is harder than authentic kindness.
