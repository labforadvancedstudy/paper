# Market

## Core Insight
Where desires meet and negotiate: the self-organizing space that transforms chaos into coordination.

A market is any space - physical, digital, or conceptual - where buyers and sellers find each other. From village squares to stock exchanges to dating apps, markets are humanity's coordination engines.

Markets enable:
- **Discovery** - finding who has what you want
- **Competition** - multiple options for buyers/sellers
- **Price formation** - collective negotiation of value
- **Information flow** - learning from others' actions
- **Efficiency** - resources flow to highest value use

Markets self-organize through:
- Reputation (trustworthy traders thrive)
- Price signals (guide behavior)
- Competition (keeps quality up, prices down)
- Innovation (new ways to serve needs)
- Network effects (more participants = more value)

The profound insight: markets create order without orders. No one commands the farmer to grow food or the baker to bake bread, yet shelves stay stocked. The invisible hand is really millions of visible hands coordinating through price.

Markets are computation engines, processing human desires into resource allocation.
