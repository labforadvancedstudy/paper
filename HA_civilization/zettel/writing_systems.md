# Writing Systems

## Core Insight
Writing is humanity's hack for time travel - sending thoughts across centuries without degradation.

Before writing, knowledge lived only in brains. When brains died, knowledge died. Stories mutated with each telling. The past was a game of telephone getting fuzzier each generation.

Then someone drew marks that meant something. Not pictures of things, but symbols for sounds or ideas. Suddenly thoughts could outlive thinkers. The dead could teach the unborn.

Writing changed how we think. Oral cultures think in stories, proverbs, rhythms - things easy to remember. Written cultures can think in lists, tables, arguments that would be impossible to hold in memory. Writing didn't just record thought - it upgraded it.
