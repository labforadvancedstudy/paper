# Market Failure

## Core Insight
When the invisible hand has a seizure: markets promising efficiency but delivering chaos - capitalism's confession moments.

Market failure occurs when free markets don't allocate resources efficiently. The beautiful theory crashes into ugly reality. Self-interest doesn't magically create collective good.

Failure modes:
- **Externalities** - costs/benefits leak outside
- **Public goods** - no one provides what all need
- **Monopoly power** - competition dies
- **Information asymmetry** - one side knows more
- **Incomplete markets** - some goods can't be traded

Market failures create:
- Inefficiency (waste)
- Inequity (unfair outcomes)
- Instability (boom/bust extremes)
- Environmental destruction
- Under-investment in future

The ideological battlefield: 
- Left says "See? Markets fail! Government must intervene!"
- Right says "Government failure is worse! Let markets self-correct!"
- Reality says "Both fail differently."

The nuanced truth: markets fail in predictable ways. So do interventions. The art is matching solution to specific failure, not ideology. Sometimes markets need help. Sometimes help makes things worse.
