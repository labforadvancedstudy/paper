## The Neural Basis of Empathy

Mirror neurons fire both when performing an action
and when observing others perform it -
the biological foundation of shared experience.

### The Revolutionary Discovery
- Monkey reaches for peanut: neurons fire
- Monkey watches human reach: same neurons fire
- Action and perception united
- The self-other boundary blurs

### Beyond Motor Mimicry
Mirror systems for:
- Emotional contagion (feeling others' feelings)
- Intention understanding
- Language learning
- The neural basis of culture transmission

### The Simulation Theory
Mirror neurons suggest:
- We understand others by simulation
- Running their actions in our circuits
- Consciousness isn't private but shared
- Theory of mind has neural basis

### Implications for Consciousness
- Experience is inherently social
- Self-awareness through other-awareness
- Consciousness evolved for connection
