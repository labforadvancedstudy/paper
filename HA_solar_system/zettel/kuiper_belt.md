# Kuiper Belt

## Core Insight
Beyond Neptune lies a second asteroid belt made of ice - the Solar System's freezer where pristine material from our birth 4.5 billion years ago waits in deep freeze.

The Kuiper Belt is the asteroid belt's frozen cousin. Starting at Neptune's orbit and extending outward, it contains icy bodies from tiny chunks to dwarf planets like Pluto and Eris. These objects are time capsules - too far from the Sun to be altered by heat, too small to be changed by geology. They preserve the Solar System's original ingredients like a cosmic freezer.

This frozen wasteland tells origin stories. Short-period comets come from here, diving sunward to spray gas and dust. The belt's structure records Neptune's migration - gaps where resonances cleared paths, concentrations where objects were shepherded. It's not empty space but a dynamic region where Pluto executes its tilted orbit, where planet-sized objects lurk undiscovered, where the Solar System's history lies frozen in ice and rock.
