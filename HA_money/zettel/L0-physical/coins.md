# Coins

## Core Insight
Coins are humanity's first successful attempt to make value portable, durable, and countable - transforming abstract worth into something you can jingle in your pocket.

The weight of coins in your hand carries thousands of years of human trust. That satisfying clink when they hit the counter isn't just sound - it's the echo of every transaction since ancient Lydia. Coins work because they're physical: you can't copy-paste metal, you can't delete weight, you can't hack gravity.

The genius of coins:
- Standardized weight = standardized value
- Durable metal = lasting worth
- Official stamps = trusted authority
- Small denominations = accessible trade
- Physical presence = psychological reality

Even in our digital age, coins persist. Why? Because there's something fundamentally honest about physical money. It can't be in two places at once. When you give it away, you don't have it anymore. No complex systems needed - just the ancient agreement that this disk of metal means something.
