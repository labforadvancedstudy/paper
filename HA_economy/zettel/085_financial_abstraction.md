# Financial Abstraction

## Core Insight
Finance is abstraction layered on abstraction - from real goods to money to securities to derivatives to synthetic derivatives, each layer further from reality but enabling new forms of economic coordination.

Start with basics. Money abstracts value from specific goods. Stocks abstract ownership from control. Bonds abstract lending from relationships. Each abstraction loses information but gains flexibility.

Then it compounds. Options are bets on stocks. CDOs are bundles of bonds. Synthetic CDOs are bets on CDO performance without owning them. CDO-squared are CDOs of CDOs. We've built a tower of babel in mathematics.

Each layer serves a purpose. Derivatives let farmers hedge weather risk. Securitization spreads risk across investors. Options enable strategic positioning. The abstractions aren't inherently evil - they're tools for managing uncertainty.

But abstraction creates distance. The mortgage trader never meets the homeowner. The algorithm doesn't know it's trading food futures that affect real hunger. Finance becomes a game played with numbers that happen to represent human lives.

2008 showed what happens when abstraction untethers completely. Nobody knew what CDOs contained. Risk models used gaussian copulas that assumed independence. The mathematical beauty obscured the rotten foundations. Reality reasserted itself violently.

The paradox: we need financial abstraction for modern economy but each layer increases systemic risk. We're building ever more sophisticated maps while losing touch with the territory.
