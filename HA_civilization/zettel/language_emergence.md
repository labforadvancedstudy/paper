# Language Emergence

## Core Insight
Language is the universe's hack for getting separate brains to run the same software.

Grunts became words. Words became sentences. Sentences became ideas that could leap from brain to brain like viruses. Suddenly, what I know, you can know, just by making mouth-sounds.

But language isn't just communication - it's a consciousness upgrade. Without words for "yesterday" and "tomorrow," can you really think about time? Without "justice" or "beauty," can those concepts exist in your mind?

Language creates reality. When we named things, we carved up the continuous universe into discrete chunks our brains could handle. The world isn't really divided into "trees" and "bushes" - we drew those lines with words.
