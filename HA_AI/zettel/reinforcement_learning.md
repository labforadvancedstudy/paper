# Reinforcement Learning

## Core Insight
AI learns like life learns - through trial, error, and reward, discovering strategies no one could have programmed by playing millions of games against itself.

No teacher says "this is right." Instead: try something, see what happens, adjust. Like a rat in a maze, but the maze is chess, or protein folding, or robot walking. The AI begins knowing nothing, flailing randomly. Slowly, patterns emerge: this action led to reward, that one to punishment.

The beauty is in what emerges. AlphaGo discovered moves human masters never imagined in thousands of years. OpenAI's hide-and-seek agents invented tool use, ramp building, box surfing. Given only goals and feedback, AI finds solutions that surprise its creators. Evolution in silicon, running at electronic speed.
