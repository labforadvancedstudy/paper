# Information Theory

## Core Insight
Art as signal and noise - where Shannon's mathematics meets aesthetic experience, revealing how meaning emerges from entropy and redundancy in visual communication.

Information concepts applied:
- Entropy (uncertainty/surprise)
- Redundancy (pattern/prediction)
- Channel capacity
- Signal/noise ratio
- Compression/loss

Art information content:
- High entropy = complex/chaotic
- Low entropy = minimal/ordered
- Redundancy = style/recognition
- Noise = error/glitch
- Compression = abstraction

Communication model:
- Artist (sender)
- Artwork (message)
- Medium (channel)
- Viewer (receiver)
- Context (noise)

Aesthetic information:
- Semantic (meaning)
- Syntactic (structure)
- Pragmatic (effect)
- Entropic (surprise)
- Redundant (convention)

Digital implications:
- Lossless vs. lossy
- Compression artifacts
- Bandwidth limits
- Error correction
- Format obsolescence

Generative applications:
- Markov chains
- Entropy sources
- Pattern analysis
- Style transfer
- Complexity measures

Critical insights:
- Meaning ≠ information
- Culture = shared codes
- Innovation = controlled entropy
- Tradition = redundancy
- Glitch = information

Philosophical questions:
- Is beauty measurable?
- Can meaning quantify?
- Does complexity = value?
- Information without meaning?
- Optimal entropy level?

Information theory illuminates but doesn't explain art. Useful framework, not complete theory. Art exceeds information while being made of it.
