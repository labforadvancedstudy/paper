# Social Contract

## Core Insight
Every company exists by implicit social contract - society grants the privilege to operate in exchange for value creation beyond profit extraction.

The contract is unwritten but real. Society provides: legal framework, educated workforce, infrastructure, stable currency, property rights. Companies provide: employment, innovation, tax revenue, goods/services. Violate the contract, lose social license.

History shows contract evolution. Industrial era: provide jobs. Information era: provide innovation. Sustainability era: provide regeneration. The terms constantly renegotiate as society's needs change. Yesterday's good corporate citizen becomes today's pariah.

Smart companies read contract changes early. They shift from shareholder to stakeholder capitalism before forced. They self-regulate before regulated. They solve social problems profitably. The most enduring companies align private gain with public good.
