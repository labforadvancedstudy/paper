# Growth Mindset: Ability Beliefs

**Core Concept**: Believing abilities can grow creates resilience; believing they're fixed creates fragility.

## One-Line Definition
"I can't do it YET" changes everything - the word transforms failure from verdict to information.

## Simple Mental Model
Like muscles versus height - if you believe intelligence is like height (fixed), you give up. If like muscles (trainable), you persist.

## Key Mechanism
1. Face challenge or failure
2. Attribution to effort vs. ability
3. Adaptive vs. helpless response
4. Different learning trajectory

## Practical Example
Two students fail a test. Fixed mindset: "I'm not a math person." Growth mindset: "I need different study strategies." Same failure, opposite futures.

## Common Misconception
Growth mindset means believing you can do anything. Actually, it means believing you can improve - realistic growth, not magical thinking.
