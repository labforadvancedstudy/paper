# Propellant

## Core Insight
The stuff we throw away to go places - mass that exists solely to be violently expelled, turning stored chemical energy into momentum through the brutal arithmetic of action and reaction.

Propellant is spacecraft food, but backwards. Instead of taking mass in for energy, rockets get energy by throwing mass out. The faster you throw it (exhaust velocity), the less you need. But you always need disturbingly much.

The chemistry determines capability:
- **Solids**: Simple, reliable, but no shutoff
- **Hypergolics**: Ignite on contact, toxic, storable
- **Cryogenics**: Maximum performance, boil-off problems
- **Monopropellants**: Simple systems, low performance
- **Exotic**: Ion, nuclear, theoretical promises

Common combinations reveal trade-offs:
- **LOX/RP-1**: Kerosene and oxygen, reliable workhorse
- **LOX/LH2**: Maximum chemical ISP, handling nightmare
- **N2O4/MMH**: Storable but carcinogenic
- **LOX/Methane**: Mars-manufacturable compromise
- **Solid**: Ammonium perchlorate/aluminum/polymer

The tyranny of physics:
- 90% of rocket mass is propellant
- Each second of burn consumes tons
- Residuals are unusable mass
- Ullage space needed for expansion
- Thermal management critical

Beyond chemistry:
- **Electric**: Xenon ions, tiny thrust, extreme ISP
- **Solar/Laser**: External energy, no reaction mass
- **Nuclear**: Heat hydrogen, political impossibility
- **Antimatter**: Theoretical maximum, practically never

Propellant choices cascade through design:
- Tank size/material/insulation
- Engine type/cooling method
- Ground infrastructure
- Mission duration limits
- Crew safety measures

In space engineering, propellant is everything. It's what you buy with money, carry with structure, and spend for velocity. Run out, and physics strands you forever.
