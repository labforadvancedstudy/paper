# Beauty

## Core Insight
The embarrassing necessity - where aesthetic pleasure persists despite theoretical suspicion, creating secret hierarchies while pretending indifference to visual delight.

Beauty's history:
- Classical proportion
- Medieval transcendence
- Renaissance mathematics
- Romantic sublime
- Modern rejection
- Contemporary return?

Why beauty suspicious:
- Class associations
- Gender stereotypes
- Power naturalized
- Difference excluded
- Criticality numbed

Anti-beauty strategies:

- Abject art
- Digital glitch

Yet beauty persists:
- Viewers seek it
- Artists make it
- Markets price it
- Bodies crave it
- Denial rings false

New beauty theories:
- Beauty as politics (Hickey)
- Beauty as ethics (Scarry)
- Beauty as resistance
- Beauty as complexity
- Beauty as emergence

Cultural beauties:

Contemporary tension:

- Sincerity risks naivety

Truth: Beauty moves us. Denial dishonest. Question whose beauty, serving what. But don't pretend immune. Even ugly seeks own beauty.
