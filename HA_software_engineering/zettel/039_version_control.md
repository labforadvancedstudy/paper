# version_control

**Level**: L3  
**Domain**: Software Engineering

## Core Concept
The time machine for code history - tracking changes, enabling collaboration, and providing the ability to undo.

## Irreducible Truth
Version control transforms code from a snapshot into a living history. Every change tells a story.

## Metaphysical Structure
- **Ontology**: Code exists in time as well as space
- **Epistemology**: We know through diffs and commits
- **Axiology**: History has value; mistakes are learning

## Practical Implementation
```bash
# Initialize repository - birth of history
git init

# Stage changes - select what becomes history
git add feature.py

# Commit - crystallize a moment in time
git commit -m "Add user authentication"

# Branch - explore alternate timelines
git checkout -b experimental-feature

# Merge - unite parallel histories
git merge experimental-feature

# Time travel - revisit the past
git checkout abc123f
```

## HA Integration
HA recognizes version control as externalized memory - the ability to remember not just what, but why and when.

## Key Insights
1. Commit messages are documentation of intent
2. Branches are hypotheses about the future
3. Merge conflicts are competing realities
