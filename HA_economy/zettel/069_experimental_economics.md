# Experimental Economics

## Core Insight
Experimental economics brought the laboratory to the dismal science - instead of just theorizing about human behavior, economists started running controlled experiments to see what people actually do.

Vernon Smith pioneered the revolution. Set up a market in a lab. Give subjects money. Let them trade. See what happens. Shocking result: even with untrained students, markets quickly converge to theoretical equilibrium prices. The invisible hand works in the lab.

But experiments also revealed where theory fails. The ultimatum game: Player A divides $10 between herself and Player B. B can accept or reject (both get nothing). Theory says A should offer $0.01 and B should accept (better than nothing). Reality? Most offer $4-5. Offers below $3 get rejected. Humans care about fairness, not just money.

Public goods games showed both promise and peril. People start cooperative but free-riding emerges over time. Unless... you add punishment options. Then cooperation sustains. Humans are conditional cooperators with a taste for vengeance.

The beauty of experiments: you can test institutions before implementing them. Auction designs, market rules, policy interventions - try them in the lab first. The FCC spectrum auctions that raised billions? Designed and tested by experimental economists.

But there's a limitation: labs aren't reality. Stakes are smaller, contexts artificial, subjects are WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic). Do lab findings translate? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The lab is a beginning, not an end.
