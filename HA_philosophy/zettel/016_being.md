# Being

## Core Insight
The "is" in "what is" - existence before existents.

## Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing?

Heidegger's obsession: the difference between beings (things that exist) and Being itself (existence as such). Like asking not about waves but about what makes waving possible.

L1: Stuff is there
L2: Creation from void
L3: To be is to be perceived
L4: Being as category
L5: Existence precedes essence
L6: Being as presence
L7: Being as event
L8: Being as information
L9: Being/non-being unite

The vertigo: you can think about everything that exists, but can you think existence itself?
