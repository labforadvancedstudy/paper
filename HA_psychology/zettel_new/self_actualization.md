# Self-Actualization

The drive to become everything you're capable of becoming. Maslow's pinnacle of human development where potential meets realization.

## Characteristics
- Acceptance of self and others
- Spontaneity and naturalness
- Problem-centered (not ego-centered)
- Need for solitude
- Independence from culture
- Peak experiences
- Deep interpersonal relationships
- Creative expression

## The Paradox
You can't pursue self-actualization directly. Like happiness, it emerges as a byproduct of living authentically and serving something beyond yourself.

## Modern Critique
- Cultural bias (individualistic)
- Assumes basic needs are met
- Vague and unmeasurable
- Ignores social context

## Contemporary View
Less a destination, more a process of continual growth and authentic expression.
