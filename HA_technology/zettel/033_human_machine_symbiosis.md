# Human Machine Symbiosis

## Core Insight
Human-machine symbiosis isn't future - it's now. We're already cyborgs, our cognition distributed across biological and digital substrates, inseparable and co-dependent.

Consider: you "know" thousands of facts actually stored in your phone. Your "memory" includes Google. Your "social network" exists in servers. The boundary between your mind and your devices is philosophical, not functional.

The symbiosis deepens daily. Algorithms complete our sentences, suggest our choices, filter our reality. We train them; they train us. It's not human vs. machine but human-machine vs. problems too complex for either alone.

From eyeglasses to neural implants: we've always been cyborgs, just increasingly intimate ones. The question isn't whether to merge with machines but how consciously we'll direct the merger already underway.
