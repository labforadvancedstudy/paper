# Prompt Engineering

## Core Insight
The art of talking to AI - discovering that how you ask determines what you get, turning conversation into programming.

"Write a poem" gets you doggerel. "Write a poem in the style of Emily Dickinson about the loneliness of electrons" gets you art. The model contains multitudes; prompts are keys to different rooms. The same AI that writes children's stories writes doctoral dissertations - the difference is in the asking.

Prompt engineering reveals AI as a strange kind of universal function, where natural language becomes code. We're programming with prose, coding with conversation. The prompt is both input and instruction, data and algorithm. We've built machines that run on meaning.
