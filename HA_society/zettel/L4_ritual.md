# Ritual

## Core Insight
The social technology that transforms ordinary time into sacred time, binding communities through shared performance of meaning.

Weddings, funerals, graduations, even birthday parties - rituals mark transitions and create collective effervescence. They're society's way of saying "this matters" loud enough for everyone to hear and feel it together.

Rituals work through repetition and symbol. The wedding ring, the graduation cap, the funeral flowers - objects become sacred through ritual use. Participants know their roles: when to stand, what to say, how to feel. This choreography creates unity.

Durkheim's insight: rituals don't just mark social facts, they create them. You're not married until the ritual says so. The diploma doesn't make you educated, but the graduation makes you a graduate. Rituals transform social reality through collective agreement.
