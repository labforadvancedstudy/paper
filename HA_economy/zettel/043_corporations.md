# Corporations

## Core Insight
A corporation is humanity's strangest invention - an imaginary person that can own things, make contracts, and live forever.

Think about how weird this is. Apple Inc. isn't Tim Cook or any employee. It's not the buildings or the products. It's a legal fiction - a shared hallucination that we all agree to treat as if it were a person. This "person" can buy land, hire people, sue and be sued, and accumulate wealth across centuries.

The corporation solved a crucial problem: how do you pool resources from many people for big projects while limiting their risk? Before corporations, if your business partner messed up, creditors could take your house. With corporations, you only lose what you invested.

This legal innovation unleashed unprecedented economic growth. Suddenly, thousands of strangers could pool resources for railroads, factories, and moon missions. The corporation became a kind of economic superhero - immortal, with limited liability, and the combined resources of all its shareholders.

But this superhero has no conscience. It exists only to fulfill its corporate purpose (usually profit). This creates both miracles (smartphones) and disasters (pollution). The corporation is humanity's most powerful tool, and like all powerful tools, it can build or destroy.
