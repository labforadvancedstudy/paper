# Colonial Organisms

Where does individual end, society begin?

Siphonophores: Not jellyfish, but jellyfish cities.
Each part = specialized individual.
Can't survive alone.

Slime molds: Sometimes one, sometimes many.
Crisis = merge into supercell.
Problem solved = split again.

Colonies blur the line.
We're all colonies of colonies.
