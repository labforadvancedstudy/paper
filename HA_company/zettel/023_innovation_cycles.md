# Innovation Cycles

## Core Insight
Innovation follows rhythms - from wild exploration to focused exploitation, creative chaos to systematic scaling, breakthrough to optimization, then back again.

Companies breathe innovation in cycles. Explore phase: many bets, high failure, learning focus. Exploit phase: fewer bets, optimization, profit focus. Too much exploration, company bleeds resources. Too much exploitation, company stagnates. Balance is life.

The cycles nest: daily experiments within monthly sprints within quarterly plans within annual strategies. Each level has its rhythm. Startups live in perpetual exploration. Mature companies in extended exploitation. The successful manage multiple cycles simultaneously.

Market forces drive cycles. Competition demands innovation. Customers demand reliability. Investors demand returns. These tensions create oscillation between creating new value and capturing existing value. Companies surf these waves or drown in them.
