# Interpretation

## Core Insight
The creative act repeated - where meaning emerges not from artist's intention or work itself but in the space between artwork and viewer, making everyone a co-author.

Interpretation theories:
- Intentionalist (artist's meaning)
- Formalist (work itself)
- Reader response (viewer creates)
- Contextual (historical situation)
- Pluralist (multiple valid)

Hermeneutic circle:
- Parts inform whole
- Whole shapes parts
- Understanding spirals
- Prejudice productive
- Fusion of horizons

Interpretation strategies:
- Close looking
- Historical research
- Theoretical frameworks
- Personal association
- Community dialogue

Against interpretation (Sontag):
- Reduces to content
- Ignores sensuous surface
- Intellectualizes experience
- Tames disturbing art
- Replaces with meaning

Contemporary complications:
- Artist statements everywhere
- Wall texts guide
- Audio tours direct
- Google searches inform
- Social media influences

Power in interpretation:
- Who interprets whom?
- Which languages count?
- Expert vs. amateur
- Institution vs. individual
- Dominant vs. marginal

Digital interpretation:
- Collective meaning-making
- Algorithm recommendations
- Hashtag taxonomies
- Comment conversations
- Meme mutations

Limits acknowledged:
- Some things uninterpretable
- Meaning exceeds language
- Cultural codes vary
- Time changes everything
- Mystery valuable

Interpretation paradox: Necessary but insufficient. Opens but reduces. Connects but distances. Best interpretation acknowledges its own limits.
