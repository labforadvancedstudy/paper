# Abstract Expressionism

## Core Insight
America's first original movement - where gesture became content, scale overwhelmed, and the artist's psyche spilled directly onto canvas, claiming painting as existential act.

Movement characteristics:
- Gestural abstraction (Pollock, de Kooning)
- Color field (Rothko, Newman)
- Action painting (process visible)
- Scale monumental (viewer enveloped)
- Individuality paramount (signature styles)

Philosophical underpinnings:
- Existentialism (authentic gesture)
- Jungian psychology (collective unconscious)
- Zen Buddhism (spontaneity)
- American individualism (heroic artist)
- Post-war trauma (unspeakable expressed)

Technical innovations:
- Floor painting (Pollock's drips)
- Staining (Frankenthaler's method)
- House paint (industrial materials)
- Unstretched canvas (process emphasized)
- All-over composition (no hierarchy)

Cultural context crucial:
- New York rising (Paris displaced)
- CIA funding (cultural cold war)
- Masculine mythology (macho painters)
- Critical champions (Greenberg, Rosenberg)
- Market ascendance (American power)

Women erased/recovered:
- Krasner, Mitchell, Frankenthaler
- Equal innovators
- Different recognition
- Feminist revision
- Market correction ongoing

Legacy complicated:
- Painting's last stand?
- Influence inescapable
- Parody common
- Revival cycles
- Zombie formalism

Contemporary relevance:
- Gesture in digital
- Scale in installation
- Process in performance
- Emotion everywhere
- Individual/collective tension
