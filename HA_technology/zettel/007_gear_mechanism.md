# Gear Mechanism

## Core Insight
Gears are crystallized ratio - mathematical relationships made metal, forcing separate motions into precise coordination through interlocking geometry.

A gear is a wheel that refuses isolation. Those teeth demand engagement, create dependency, enforce relationship. When gears mesh, they create a contract: your motion becomes my motion, but transformed by our ratio.

The beauty: continuous lever action. Each tooth is a tiny lever; the gear is infinite levers in a circle. This transforms rotation - speed for torque, direction for direction, axis for axis. Gears make motion sculptable.

From clockwork to transmission, gears create mechanical logic. They're physical IF-THEN statements: IF this turns 10 times THEN that turns once. They compute with rotation, making machinery that thinks in circles.
