# Business Cycle

## Core Insight
The economy's heartbeat: expansion and contraction in endless rhythm - collective mood swings made material.

Business cycles are hope and fear dancing together. Optimism builds into mania, crashes into despair, recovers into hope. The economy breathes in booms and exhales busts.

Cycle phases:
- **Expansion** - growth, hiring, optimism
- **Peak** - maximum activity, overconfidence
- **Contraction** - decline, layoffs, fear
- **Trough** - bottom, maximum pessimism
- **Recovery** - green shoots, cautious hope

Cycle drivers:
- Psychology (animal spirits)
- Credit expansion/contraction
- Investment waves
- Inventory adjustments
- Policy responses

The mystery: why can't we smooth cycles? Despite all knowledge, all tools, economies still swing between extremes. Human psychology seems hardwired for overshooting.

Cycles create massive waste - idle factories in busts, reckless building in booms. Yet they also clear out inefficiency, force innovation, redistribute wealth. Creative destruction has a rhythm.

Understanding cycles means accepting economics isn't physics - it's collective human emotion manifested.
