# Learned Helplessness: The Giving Up Trap

**Core Concept**: Repeated failure when escape is impossible teaches us to stop trying, even when escape becomes possible.

## One-Line Definition
Past powerlessness programs future paralysis - we learn that effort is futile.

## Simple Mental Model
Like an elephant tied with a thin rope. As a baby, the rope was unbreakable. As an adult, the elephant doesn't try - it "knows" escape is impossible.

## Key Mechanism
1. Repeated inescapable stress
2. Learn that actions don't affect outcomes
3. Stop trying to escape
4. Generalize helplessness to new situations

## Practical Example
A student fails math repeatedly despite studying. Eventually stops trying in all subjects, even ones they could excel in. The lesson learned: "effort doesn't matter."

## Common Misconception
Learned helplessness is laziness or lack of motivation. Actually, it's a rational response to truly uncontrollable situations that becomes overgeneralized.
