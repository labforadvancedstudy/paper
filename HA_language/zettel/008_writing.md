# Writing

## Core Insight
Frozen speech - making the ephemeral eternal through visual marks.

## The Second Revolution

If language was humanity's first revolution, writing was the second. It allowed:
- Memory beyond brains
- Communication across time
- Accumulation of knowledge
- Civilization as we know it

Writing system evolution:
L1: Pictures (cave paintings, petroglyphs)
L2: Logograms (one symbol = one word) 
L3: Syllabaries (one symbol = one syllable)
L4: Alphabets (one symbol = one sound)
L5: Mixed systems (like English spelling!)
L6: Digital encoding (ASCII, Unicode)
L7: Emoji (full circle to pictures?)

Major innovations:
- Sumerian cuneiform (~3200 BCE): First true writing
- Chinese characters: Still in use after 3000+ years
- Phoenician alphabet: Ancestor of most alphabets
- Korean Hangul: Scientifically designed alphabet

Writing isn't just transcribed speech - it's a different medium with its own rules.
