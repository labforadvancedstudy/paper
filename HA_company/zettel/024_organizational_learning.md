# Organizational Learning

## Core Insight
Organizational learning transcends individual knowledge - it's how companies encode experience into structure, making tomorrow's organization smarter than today's.

Individual learning dies with individuals. Organizational learning persists through systems, processes, culture. What one person discovers becomes what everyone knows. Mistakes become institutional memory. Success patterns become standard practice.

Learning happens at multiple levels. Single-loop: fix problems. Double-loop: question assumptions. Triple-loop: examine purpose itself. Most companies master single-loop. Few achieve double. Rare ones reach triple. Each level exponentially increases adaptive capacity.

But organizations also learn dysfunction. Bad habits institutionalize. Workarounds become process. Politics becomes culture. Unlearning proves harder than learning. The most adaptive companies constantly examine what they've learned, keeping wisdom, discarding obsolescence.
