# Cosmic Web

## Core Insight
Galaxies don't scatter randomly through space but form a vast web - filaments of matter stretching across billions of light-years, with great voids between, like soap bubbles on cosmic scale.

Mapping millions of galaxies revealed the universe's largest structure. Galaxies cluster along filaments - cosmic highways of dark matter and gas. Where filaments intersect, galaxy clusters form. Between filaments lie voids, nearly empty regions 100 million light-years across. The cosmic web emerged from quantum fluctuations in the infant universe, amplified by gravity over billions of years.

Dark matter forms the scaffolding. Its gravity pulls normal matter into filaments where galaxies form. Simulations starting from CMB fluctuations reproduce the observed web. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey mapped this structure in unprecedented detail. We live in a cosmic city: galaxies are houses, clusters are neighborhoods, filaments are streets, and voids are parks. The universe's largest patterns trace back to the smallest quantum fluctuations. Structure exists at every scale, but the cosmic web is the grandest architecture of all.
