# Trauma: Memory Fragmentation

**Core Concept**: Traumatic memories store differently - in fragments rather than coherent narratives.

## One-Line Definition
Trauma shatters memory like a broken mirror - pieces everywhere but no complete reflection.

## Simple Mental Model
Normal memory is like a movie. Trauma memory is like scattered film frames - a smell here, an image there, a feeling with no context.

## Key Mechanism
1. Extreme stress disrupts hippocampus
2. Memories encode in fragments
3. Sensory/emotional pieces without narrative
4. Triggered by similar fragments

## Practical Example
A car accident survivor smells rubber and panics, sees red and freezes, but can't tell a coherent story of what happened. The pieces float disconnected.

## Common Misconception
Trauma is just a very bad memory. Actually, it's qualitatively different - stored and retrieved through different brain systems entirely.
