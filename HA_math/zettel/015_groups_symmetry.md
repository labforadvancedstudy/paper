# Groups and the Algebra of Symmetry

## Core Insight
Groups capture the essence of symmetry - they're the mathematics of things that stay the same when things change.

## Content
A group is disarmingly simple: a set with an operation that combines elements. But this simplicity encodes all of symmetry.

Group axioms:
- Closure: combining group elements gives a group element
- Associativity: (ab)c = a(bc)
- Identity: there's an element that does nothing
- Inverses: every action can be undone

Examples reveal the concept:
- Integers under addition (identity: 0, inverse: negation)
- Rotations of a square (identity: no rotation, inverse: opposite rotation)
- Permutations (identity: do nothing, inverse: undo)
- Matrices with non-zero determinant (identity: I, inverse: matrix inverse)

But groups are about more than examples - they're about structure:
- Subgroups reveal hidden symmetries
- Quotient groups collapse symmetries
- Group homomorphisms preserve structure
- Simple groups are atoms of symmetry

The power of abstraction:
- Galois used groups to prove unsolvability of quintics
- Crystallographers classify possible crystal symmetries
- Physicists find conservation laws via Noether's theorem
- Rubik's cube is a group theory puzzle

Groups taught us that symmetry isn't about shapes - it's about transformations that preserve structure.
