# Network Effects

## Core Insight
Network effects are economic gravity - the more massive a network becomes, the more powerfully it attracts new members, creating winner-take-all dynamics.

The telephone was useless when only one person had it. With two people, it had one connection. With four people, six connections. With n people, n(n-1)/2 connections. This is Metcalfe's Law: network value grows quadratically with users.

But it's not just about connections. Facebook isn't valuable because you can connect to 3 billion people - it's valuable because your friends are there. This creates lock-in. Even if a better social network appears, why switch if your network isn't there? The inferior product wins through network mass.

Network effects create natural monopolies. Once one network dominates, competitors face the chicken-and-egg problem: users won't come without other users. This is why we have one Google, one Facebook, one Amazon. The network effect moat is wider than any patent or capital advantage.

The dark side: network monopolies can extract massive rents. They become too big to fail, too connected to regulate, too essential to avoid. They're economic black holes, bending all activity toward themselves.

The question for our age: are network effects so powerful they break traditional economics? When winner-takes-all, does competition still work?
