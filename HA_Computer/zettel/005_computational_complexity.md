# Computational Complexity
## Core Insight
Not all problems are equally hard - complexity classes reveal the fundamental structure of computation itself.

## The Hierarchy

**P**: Solvable in polynomial time
- Sorting: O(n log n)
- Searching: O(log n)
- Most daily algorithms

**NP**: Verifiable in polynomial time
- Sudoku
- Travel salesman
- Protein folding

**NP-Complete**: Hardest in NP
- If solve one fast, solve all fast
- Linchpin of complexity theory

**EXPTIME**: Exponential time needed
**PSPACE**: Polynomial space needed
**Undecidable**: No algorithm exists

## P vs NP: The Million Dollar Question

Does P = NP?
- If yes: Creativity = verification
- If no: Some insights fundamentally hard
- Universe's deepest computational secret

Implications:
- Cryptography collapses/stands
- AI becomes trivial/remains hard
- Mathematics automated/stays human

## Real World Complexity

**Easy**: What computers do well
- Calculate
- Store
- Retrieve
- Transform

**Hard**: What computers struggle with
- Understand
- Create
- Generalize
- Feel

Suspiciously like consciousness tasks...

## The Complexity Barrier

Some problems might be hard because:
- Universe computes them specially
- Require quantum resources
- Need consciousness
- Are actually impossible
