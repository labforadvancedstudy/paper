# Economic Justice

## Core Insight
Economic justice is the eternal question - what distribution of resources is fair? - wrapped in the uncomfortable fact that any answer requires moral choices economics pretends to avoid.

Start with competing visions. Libertarians: justice is whatever emerges from voluntary exchange. If you earned it fairly, it's yours. Rawlsians: justice is what we'd choose behind a "veil of ignorance" not knowing if we'd be rich or poor. Utilitarians: justice is whatever maximizes total happiness.

Each sounds reasonable. Each leads to radically different worlds. Pure libertarianism accepts any inequality from fair processes. Rawlsianism might mandate massive redistribution. Utilitarianism might sacrifice individuals for the greater good.

But it gets messier. What's "earned fairly"? The CEO makes 300x the worker - is that merit or market failure? The programmer in Silicon Valley makes 10x one in India - is that skill or birthplace lottery? Inheritance means some start life millionaires - is that family rights or unfair advantage?

There's also the production/distribution tension. Perfect equality might kill incentives to produce. Perfect inequality might kill social cohesion. Somewhere between lies justice, but where?

The practical challenge: we must make policies despite philosophical uncertainty. Progressive taxation, minimum wages, inheritance taxes - each embeds assumptions about justice. We implement ethics through economics, pretending it's just efficiency.

Economic justice forces the ultimate question: is the economy for humans, or humans for the economy?
