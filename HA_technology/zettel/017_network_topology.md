# Network Topology

## Core Insight
Network topology is relationship geometry - the shape of connections determines the behavior of the whole, making structure more important than nodes.

Networks are not about nodes but edges. The same computers connected as star, mesh, or ring behave completely differently. Topology is destiny: it determines failure modes, communication patterns, growth possibilities.

The internet teaches this daily. Its packet-switched, redundant mesh topology makes it antifragile. Break any link, routes adapt. Compare to hub-and-spoke: kill the hub, kill the network. Structure determines survivability.

From neural networks to social networks to supply chains: topology rules. Small-world networks enable viral spread. Scale-free networks create hubs and vulnerability. Random networks resist targeted attack. Choose your topology, choose your fate.
