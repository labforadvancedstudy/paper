# Purpose Profit Paradox

## Core Insight
The paradox: companies that exist solely for profit often earn less than those driven by purpose, yet without profit, purpose-driven companies cease to exist.

Profit is to company as breathing to human - necessary but not sufficient for meaningful existence. Companies optimizing only profit become hollow, losing employee engagement, customer loyalty, social license. The profit evaporates with the meaning.

Purpose-driven companies attract better talent, inspire customer devotion, earn societal support. But purpose without profit is charity, not company. The tension creates dynamic balance. Too much either way destroys the organism.

The resolution: profit enables purpose, purpose sustains profit. They're not opposing forces but complementary energies. The healthiest companies surf this paradox, using profit to fuel purpose, purpose to generate sustainable profit. Neither slave to money nor martyr to mission.
