# Ritual Body

## Core Insight
The body knows how to pray before the mind understands why - sacred movement creates sacred space.

Kneel and something in you surrenders. Raise your hands and something in you reaches. Bow and something in you humbles. The body has its own wisdom, older than words. Religious ritual engages this somatic knowledge.

Watch any deep ritual:
- Muslims prostrating in perfect synchrony
- Jews davening, bodies becoming prayer
- Christians kneeling at communion
- Buddhists walking meditation, each step awareness
- Hindus performing mudras, hands speaking divinity

The ritual body is different from the everyday body:
- Movements become deliberate, meaningful
- Breath deepens, synchronizes with others
- Awareness heightens to gesture's significance
- Individual body joins collective body
- Physical becomes spiritual vessel

We think ourselves into faith less than we move ourselves into it. The skeptic who kneels may find themselves believing. The believer who stops ritual practice may find faith fading. The body teaches what the mind struggles to grasp.

Ritual body bridges the gap between material and spiritual. Through sacred movement, flesh becomes word, gesture becomes prayer, human becomes more than human.
