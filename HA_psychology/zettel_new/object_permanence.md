# Object Permanence

The understanding that objects continue to exist even when we can't see them. The cognitive milestone that transforms babies from philosophical solipsists to naive realists.

## Piaget's Discovery
Before 8 months: Out of sight, out of mind (literally)
After 8 months: Hidden objects still exist
Full mastery: 18-24 months

## The A-not-B Error
Classic mistake at 8-10 months:
- Hide toy at location A repeatedly
- Baby retrieves successfully
- Hide toy at location B (while baby watches)
- Baby still searches at A

This reveals the fragility of early object permanence.

## Implications
- Foundation for memory
- Enables attachment (missing caregivers)
- Allows symbolic thought
- Precursor to language
