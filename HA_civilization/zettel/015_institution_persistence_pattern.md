# Institution Persistence Pattern

Institutions outlive all members.

How?
- Formal rules (constitution)
- Role abstraction (president, not person)
- Ritual continuity (ceremonies)
- Physical anchors (buildings)

Universities, religions, governments persist centuries.
Individuals are temporary; patterns permanent.
