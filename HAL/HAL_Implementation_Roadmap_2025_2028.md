## Executive Summary

This document outlines a concrete 3-year implementation plan for the Hierarchical Abstraction Layer (HAL) system, progressing from proof-of-concept to production deployment. Each phase includes specific milestones, resource requirements, and success metrics aligned with the theoretical frameworks presented in our L1-L5 papers.
