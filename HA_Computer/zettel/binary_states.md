# Binary States

## Core Insight
All the universe's complexity reduced to yes/no - the ultimate simplification that enables infinite complexity.

Why binary? Because it's the smallest possible choice. On/off. True/false. 1/0. You can't subdivide a decision further. And in a noisy electrical world, two states are easiest to distinguish. High voltage or low. Current or no current.

But here's the magic: combine enough binary choices and you can represent anything. Numbers, letters, colors, sounds, thoughts. The entire works of Shakespeare in 1s and 0s. Your grandmother's photo. The blueprint for life itself. All from asking "yes or no?" millions of times.
