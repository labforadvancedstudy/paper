# Training Data

## Core Insight
AI learns from examples like children learn from experience - but instead of years, it consumes millions of instances in hours, becoming what it eats.

Every photo labeled "cat," every email marked "spam," every move in a chess game becomes a teacher. The AI doesn't understand cats or spam or chess - it finds patterns in pixels, words, positions. Feed it biased data, get biased results. Feed it the internet, get... the internet, with all its beauty and horror.

The hunger is infinite. More data means better patterns, better patterns mean better predictions. So we feed it everything: our photos, our conversations, our choices. We become the curriculum for intelligence we're creating. The student will inevitably reflect its teachers.
