# Information Theory and Life

## Core Insight
Life is a system for preserving and propagating information against the universe's tendency to forget everything.

Shannon defined information as reduction in uncertainty. Life embodies this: DNA reduces uncertainty about protein sequences. Memories reduce uncertainty about past events. Evolution reduces uncertainty about environmental fit.

But here's the twist: life doesn't just store information, it creates it. Random mutations generate new information. Natural selection tests its value. Successful information propagates. Life is an information-generating engine.

The entropy connection: information and thermodynamic entropy are linked (Shannon entropy). Creating information requires energy. Life pays for its information content by accelerating universal entropy. We're information islands in an entropy ocean.

Maxwell's demon was supposed to violate thermodynamics by sorting molecules using information. Life IS Maxwell's demon, but it pays the thermodynamic price. We sort, organize, remember - all at the cost of increasing disorder elsewhere.
