# Welfare Economics

## Core Insight
Welfare economics attempts the impossible - scientifically measuring whether economic changes make society better or worse off, turning moral questions into mathematical ones.

The problem seems simple: does a policy improve social welfare? But whose welfare? How do you compare my happiness from cheaper coffee to your sadness from job loss? How do you weigh present pleasure against future pain?

Economists tried various approaches. Pareto efficiency: a change is good if someone benefits and no one loses. Sounds reasonable but almost nothing qualifies - every change has winners and losers. Kaldor-Hicks: a change is good if winners could compensate losers. But "could" isn't "do."

Then there's the measurement problem. Utils? Dollars? Revealed preferences? Each has fatal flaws. Money isn't happiness - billionaires aren't thousand times happier than millionaires. Preferences aren't welfare - addicts prefer drugs but aren't better off.

Arrow's Impossibility Theorem delivered the death blow: no voting system can perfectly aggregate individual preferences into social preferences. There's no scientific way to determine the "social good."

Yet policy demands answers. Cost-benefit analysis proceeds despite philosophical quicksand. We assign dollar values to lives, discount future generations, pretend we can measure the unmeasurable.

Welfare economics reveals economics' dirty secret: beneath the math lie inescapable value judgments. It's ethics dressed in equations.
