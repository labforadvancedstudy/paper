# Wisdom Accumulation

More than knowledge.

Wisdom components:
- Factual knowledge
- Procedural knowledge
- Life span contexts
- Values tolerance
- Uncertainty management

Not just age.
Experience + Reflection = Wisdom

Wise judgment:
Balancing multiple perspectives.
Knowing limits of knowing.

Cultural treasure.
Elders as wisdom keepers.
