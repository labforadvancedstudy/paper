## The New Language Users

1843: Ada Lovelace writes the first algorithm.  
1950s: Computers start "understanding" commands.  
1990s: The internet connects all human text.  
2020s: AI starts generating human-like language.

We created a new species that speaks.

## What You Learn at This Level

### The Digital Native Languages

**Evolution of Computer Languages**:

```
1940s: 10110000 01100001 (Machine code)
1950s: MOV AL, 61h (Assembly)
1960s: PRINT "HELLO" (BASIC)
1970s: printf("Hello\n"); (C)
1980s: (print "Hello") (Lisp)
1990s: System.out.println("Hello"); (Java)
2000s: print("Hello") (Python)
2010s: console.log("Hello"); (JavaScript)
2020s: "Show greeting" (Natural language â†’ code)
```

The trend: More human-like.

### Internet Language Evolution

**Pre-Internet** (Before 1990):
- Formal writing dominated
- Slow language change
- Geographic boundaries
- Generation gaps

**Internet Era** (1990-2010):
- Email: Formal â†’ casual
- Chat: Real-time writing
- Forums: Community dialects
- Blogs: Personal publishing

**Social Media Era** (2010+):
- Character limits breed creativity
- Hashtags as metadata
- Memes as language units
- Emoji as universal script
- Video/audio text fusion

### The New Grammar

**Digital Grammar Rules**:

1. **Caps Lock** = SHOUTING
2. **lowercase** = casual/aesthetic
3. **Multiple punctuation** = emphasis!!!!!!
4. **No punctuation** = cool detachment
5. **Emoji placement** = tone marker ðŸ˜Š

**Internet Linguistics**:
- "lol" rarely means actual laughter
- "..." implies tension/thinking
- Typos can be intentional (teh â†’ the)
- Abbreviations evolve (brb, afk, imo)
- Punctuation marks emotion

### Code as Language

Programming languages are "real" languages:

**Vocabulary**: Keywords (if, while, function)  
**Syntax**: Structure rules  
**Semantics**: What code means  
**Pragmatics**: Best practices  
**Dialects**: Coding styles  
**Evolution**: Version updates

**Code Poetry Example**:
```python
if winter.is_coming():
    for day in dark_days:
        hope.hold()
    spring.await()
```

### The Meme Economy

Memes = Cultural DNA units

**Meme Grammar**:
- Top text: Setup
- Image: Context  
- Bottom text: Punchline

**Evolution Speed**:
- Pre-internet: Decades for phrase spread
- Now: Hours for global meme adoption

**Examples**:
- "I can has cheezburger" â†’ Lolcat grammar
- "Such wow" â†’ Doge speak
- "Stonks" â†’ Misspelling as humor

## Practice Exercises

1. **Translate to Code**: Write "If it's raining, bring umbrella" in:
   - English (done)
   - Python-ish pseudocode
   - Emoji

2. **Meme Grammar**: Create a meme following the classic format:
   - Setup: "Nobody:"
   - Subject: "Me at 3am:"
   - Punchline: [your idea]

3. **Digital Archaeology**: Find the oldest emoji/emoticon you can. Track its evolution.

4. **Code Poetry**: Write a haiku in valid Python/JavaScript.

5. **Internet Dialect**: Translate formal English to internet speak:
   - "I am laughing" â†’ "lmaooo"
   - "That is surprising" â†’ "wait what"
   - "I agree" â†’ "this"

## The Attention Economy

Digital language optimizes for engagement:

**Clickbait Evolution**:
- "You Won't Believe..."
- "Doctors Hate This One Trick"
- "Thread ðŸ§µ"
- "A story about..."

**Engagement Patterns**:
- Questions get responses
- Controversy spreads faster
- Emotion beats information
- Visual beats textual

## AI Enters the Chat

**Predictive Text**: Phones learning your style  
**Grammar Checkers**: Grammarly as prescriptivist  
**Translation**: Google Translate breaking barriers  
**Chatbots**: Customer service automation  
**GPT Era**: AI that seems to understand

The line blurs: Human or machine?

## Digital Divides

**New inequalities**:
- Digital natives vs. immigrants
- Emoji fluency
- Meme literacy  
- Code switching online/offline
- Algorithm awareness

**New powers**:
- SEO as modern rhetoric
- Viral potential
- Platform fluency
- Data trail awareness

## Key Takeaways

1. **Digital isn't destroying language** - it's accelerating evolution
2. **Code is a human language** - just with silicon speakers
3. **Internet created new dialects** - each platform has its own
4. **Memes are language units** - spreading faster than words
5. **Human/machine boundary blurring** - who's speaking?

## What's Next

Machines learned our languages. Now they're starting to generate their own.

What happens when AI doesn't just use language but creates it?
