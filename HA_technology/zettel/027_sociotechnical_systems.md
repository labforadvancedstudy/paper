# Sociotechnical Systems

## Core Insight
Sociotechnical systems are cyborg collectives - where human society and technological infrastructure merge into inseparable wholes that think, act, and evolve as one.

You can't understand modern aviation by studying only planes or only pilots. The system includes aircraft, pilots, controllers, regulations, training, maintenance culture, passenger expectations. Remove any element and the system transforms or collapses.

The boundary between human and machine blurs. Is a pilot flying the plane or is the autopilot flying with human supervision? Is social media a tool we use or a system that uses us? Sociotechnical systems make the question meaningless - we're all components now.

From cities to corporations to the internet: our most powerful systems are sociotechnical hybrids. They exhibit behaviors neither human nor machine could produce alone. They're the new organisms, and we're their cells.
