# Corporate Evolution

## Core Insight
Companies evolve like species - through variation, selection, and inheritance, but at silicon speed rather than biological time, with Lamarckian rather than Darwinian rules.

Market competition creates selection pressure. Innovation provides variation. Success traits propagate through imitation, acquisition, hiring. Failed variants die or adapt. The corporate ecosystem evolves, with new species (business models) emerging, old ones extinct.

But corporate evolution differs crucially: acquired characteristics inherit. When Google hires an Amazon executive, they acquire Amazon traits. When Facebook copies Snapchat features, evolution jumps species. Corporate DNA transfers horizontally, not just vertically.

The pace accelerates. Biological evolution took billions of years to create complexity. Corporate evolution creates global giants in decades. We're watching hyperspeed evolution, with companies as both subject and object of selection. The fittest survive, but fitness definitions evolve faster than species.
