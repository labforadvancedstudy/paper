# Naked Eye Astronomy

## Core Insight
Before any instrument, humans discovered the universe through patient observation - creating calendars, navigation systems, and mythologies from nothing but eyes and memory.

For millennia, astronomy meant looking up and remembering. No telescopes, no cameras, just human eyes tracking points of light. Yet from this simple act came profound discoveries: the year has 365 days, planets wander among fixed stars, eclipses follow patterns. Entire civilizations organized around celestial cycles observed with nothing but persistence.

The naked eye sees about 6,000 stars under perfect conditions, but only 2,500 from any location. Ancient astronomers memorized them all, noting which rose when, which never set, which heralded seasons. They discovered the ecliptic, the zodiac, the precession of equinoxes - all without magnification. The eye's limitations forced creativity: using horizon markers, inventing coordinate systems, building monuments as giant instruments. Stonehenge is a computer made of stone, calculating celestial positions through alignment.
