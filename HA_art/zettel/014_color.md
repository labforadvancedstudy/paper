# Color

## Core Insight
Light wavelengths becoming emotion - color is physics transformed into psychology, the most direct path from eye to feeling.

Color exists in three realities:
- Physics: wavelengths, spectrum, measurable
- Biology: cones, perception, processing
- Psychology: feeling, meaning, response

Artists work in all three. They mix pigments (physics), consider viewer's eye (biology), evoke emotions (psychology). Master colorists understand: color is relationship. Red alone means little. Red against green screams. Red among oranges whispers.

Color has properties:
- Hue: the name (red, blue, yellow)
- Value: lightness/darkness
- Saturation: intensity/purity
- Temperature: warm/cool
- Weight: visual heaviness

But properties don't capture color's magic. Why does certain blue make you sad? Why does orange energize? Culture layers meaning (white = purity or death), but beneath culture, bodies respond. Heart rates change. Pupils dilate. Color is drug.

Color theories proliferate:
- Complementary: opposites vibrate
- Analogous: neighbors harmonize
- Triadic: three-way balance
- Monochromatic: single hue variations

Yet great colorists break rules. Matisse's wild combinations. Van Gogh's emotional palette. They knew: theory serves intuition, not vice versa.

Digital color differs from pigment. Light mixing (additive) vs. paint mixing (subtractive). RGB vs. CMYK. Screen colors glow; paint colors absorb. Same hue, different soul.
