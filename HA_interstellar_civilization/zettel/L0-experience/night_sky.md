# Night Sky

## Core Insight
The night sky is humanity's first window to the interstellar - where every point of light whispers of other suns, other worlds, and the vast silence between them.

Looking up at night is humanity's oldest act of cosmic wonder. Those points of light aren't just pretty - they're suns. Suns with planets. Planets that might harbor life. The night sky is simultaneously humanity's greatest inspiration and greatest mystery.

The visceral experience:
- Neck craned back, eyes adjusting to darkness
- The Milky Way appearing as eyes adapt (our galaxy edge-on!)
- Shooting stars (cosmic dust hitting atmosphere)
- The moon's familiar face (our only neighbor)
- Planets wandering among fixed stars (the "wanderers")
- The overwhelming number - thousands visible, billions hidden

Every human who has ever lived has seen this same sky (mostly). We've made up stories, drawn patterns, used it to navigate. But only recently did we realize what we're really looking at: a universe filled with other suns, unimaginably far away.

The night sky poses the ultimate question: Are we alone under all these lights?
