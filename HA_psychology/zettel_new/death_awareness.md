# Death Awareness

## Core Insight
Consciousness of mortality might be the engine of human culture - we're the only animal that knows it dies.

The worm at the core of human existence: we know our story ends. This "mortality salience" drives everything from religion to achievement. Build pyramids, write books, have children - all attempts to transcend death. Terror Management Theory says culture itself is a death-denial system. We create meaning because meaninglessness plus mortality equals unbearable. Maybe consciousness evolved too far and discovered its own limits.
