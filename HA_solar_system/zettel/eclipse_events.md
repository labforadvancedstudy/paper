# Eclipse Events

## Core Insight
When cosmic bodies align perfectly, day becomes night and night reveals the Sun's crown - the universe demonstrating its clockwork precision through shadow puppetry.

A total solar eclipse stops hearts. The Moon, 400 times smaller than the Sun but 400 times closer, covers the solar disk exactly. This cosmic coincidence - too perfect to seem random - creates moments where noon becomes twilight, stars appear in daytime, and the Sun's corona blazes around lunar silhouette. Animals panic, temperatures drop, and humans throughout history have read omens in the darkness.

Lunar eclipses tell different stories - Earth's shadow turning the Moon blood red, visible to half the planet simultaneously. These events teach that shadows can reach across hundreds of thousands of miles, that celestial bodies move with such precision we can predict eclipses centuries in advance. In eclipse, the Solar System reveals itself as a machine.
