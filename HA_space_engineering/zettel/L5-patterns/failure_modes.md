# Failure Modes

## Core Insight
Space kills spacecraft in predictable ways - a catalog of doom that engineers study obsessively because understanding how things die is the first step to keeping them alive.

Space systems fail in patterns. Not random breakage but specific vulnerabilities exploited by the harsh environment. Every dead spacecraft teaches the same lessons to new generations who think they're smarter.

The classic killers:
- Launch vibration (shakes things apart)
- Thermal cycling (expansion/contraction fatigue)
- Radiation damage (electronics degradation)
- Micrometeorite impact (tiny bullets)
- Propellant depletion (stranded)
- Battery degradation (power death)
- Attitude control failure (tumbling)
- Software bugs (logic kills hardware)

Human factors multiply modes:
- Procedural errors (wrong command sent)
- Design oversights (didn't think of that)
- Manufacturing defects (bad solder joint)
- Testing gaps (didn't test that combination)
- Communication failures (lost in translation)

The cascade phenomenon:
- Single point failures propagate
- Backup systems share vulnerabilities  
- Recovery attempts cause new failures
- Time pressure compounds mistakes
- Partial failures worse than total

Learning from graves:
- Mars Climate Orbiter: Unit conversion error
- Challenger: O-ring cold sensitivity
- Columbia: Foam impact vulnerability
- Apollo 13: Oxygen tank explosion
- Dozens of forgotten failures teaching same lessons

The pattern: Most failures are boringly predictable in hindsight. The challenge isn't discovering new failure modes but maintaining vigilance against known ones across decades, personnel changes, and schedule pressure.

Space engineering is really failure prevention engineering.
