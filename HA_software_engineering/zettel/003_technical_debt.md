# Technical Debt
## Core Insight
Technical debt isn't failure - it's conscious trade-off between perfect and shipped, accumulating interest over time.

## Types of Debt

**Deliberate Prudent**: "Ship now, refactor later"
**Deliberate Reckless**: "No time for design"
**Inadvertent Prudent**: "Now we know better"
**Inadvertent Reckless**: "What's layering?"

Each type requires different treatment.

## The Interest Payments

Debt manifests as:
- Slower feature development
- More bugs
- Developer frustration
- Onboarding difficulty
- Performance degradation
- Security vulnerabilities

Compound interest is cruel.

## Debt Metaphors

**Financial**: Borrow time now, pay later
**Entropy**: Systems decay naturally
**Gardening**: Continuous maintenance needed
**Health**: Small issues become critical

Each metaphor reveals truth.

## Managing Debt

**Track it**: Make visible
**Budget it**: Allocate refactoring time
**Pay high-interest first**: Fix what hurts most
**Prevent accumulation**: Better practices
**Sometimes declare bankruptcy**: Rewrite

Balance idealism with pragmatism.

## The Paradox

Perfect code ships never.
Terrible code dies quickly.
Good enough code evolves.

Debt enables delivery.
Too much debt prevents progress.
Wisdom knows the balance.
