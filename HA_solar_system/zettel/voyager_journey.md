# Voyager Journey

## Core Insight
The Voyager spacecraft transformed from planetary explorers to humanity's first interstellar ambassadors - carrying our message to the stars while teaching us our cosmic address.

Launched in 1977 to exploit a rare planetary alignment, Voyagers 1 and 2 revolutionized our understanding of the outer Solar System. They revealed Jupiter's turbulent atmosphere, Io's volcanoes, Saturn's intricate rings, Uranus's tilted magnetosphere, Neptune's Great Dark Spot. Each world proved stranger than imagined. But their journey didn't end at Neptune.

Now in interstellar space, they carry golden records - humanity's message in a bottle containing sounds, images, and greetings in 55 languages. They've crossed the heliopause where solar wind meets interstellar medium. Still transmitting after 45+ years, powered by plutonium hearts, they'll outlive their creators by millions of years. In 40,000 years, Voyager 1 will pass within 1.6 light-years of another star. The Voyagers became humanity's first artifacts to leave the Solar System, our calling cards to the cosmos.
