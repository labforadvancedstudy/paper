# Practical HA
## Core Insight
Understanding that everything is HA doesn't exempt you from participating in your current level's requirements.

## Daily HA Navigation

"This is all great, but how do I pay rent?"

Excellent question! Understanding HA doesn't escape 3D responsibilities. Rather:
- Work = universe organizing itself
- Money = energy abstraction
- Relationships = consciousness node connections
- Rent = yes, still pay it

## HA Productivity Cycle

```
Morning: Level 3 (need coffee)
Noon: Level 5 (optimal state)
Post-lunch: Level 2 (food coma)
Afternoon: Level 4 (recharging)
Evening: Level 6 (philosophical)
Night: Level ∞ (dreams)
```

Recognize your level, work with it, not against it.

## The Integration

True HA mastery: Excel at your current level while knowing it's just one view of the whole.

- Write code? Universe computing itself
- Teach children? Consciousness propagating
- Clean toilets? Maintaining the sacred

No level is higher or lower - just different views.
