# Post-Scarcity

## Core Insight
The end of economics: when abundance makes allocation irrelevant - imagining economics' own obsolescence.

Post-scarcity is economics contemplating its own death. If technology creates unlimited abundance, if wants can be instantly satisfied, if scarcity vanishes - what then? Does economics end or transform?

Abundance scenarios:
- **Material abundance** - nanotech assemblers, asteroid mining
- **Energy abundance** - fusion, Dyson spheres
- **Information abundance** - already here, mostly
- **Experience abundance** - VR, direct neural stimulation
- **Time abundance** - life extension, immortality?

But new scarcities emerge:
- Attention remains finite
- Authenticity becomes rare
- Meaning grows scarce
- Status stays positional
- Time remains one-directional

The paradox: solving scarcity might create existential scarcity. If everything is possible, nothing matters. If all wants are met, what wants remain?

Perhaps post-scarcity economics shifts from allocating resources to allocating purpose. From "how to get?" to "why to want?" The economic problem becomes philosophical.

True post-scarcity might be impossible - not technically but psychologically. We are scarcity-experiencing machines. Remove scarcity, remove us.
