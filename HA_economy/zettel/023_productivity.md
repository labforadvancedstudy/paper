# Productivity

## Core Insight
The economic miracle: getting more from less - humanity's rebellion against scarcity through ingenuity.

Productivity is output divided by input, but it's really about transcending limits. It's how we create abundance from scarcity, how seven billion people live better than one billion did.

Productivity gains from:
- **Technology** - machines multiply human effort
- **Knowledge** - better methods, smarter processes
- **Organization** - coordination reduces waste
- **Specialization** - focused expertise
- **Capital** - tools enhance labor

Productivity paradoxes:
- More productive → need fewer workers → unemployment?
- More efficient → use more resources → Jevons paradox
- Individual vs collective productivity
- Short-term vs long-term optimization
- Productivity vs resilience trade-offs

The astounding fact: human productivity has increased ~30x since 1800. An hour of work today produces what took days before. This is history's greatest magic trick.

Yet productivity isn't everything - it can mean dehumanizing efficiency, environmental destruction, inequality. The question: productive toward what end?
