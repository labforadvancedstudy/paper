# Fractions and the Birth of Division

## Core Insight
Fractions emerge when reality refuses to be counted - when we must share three loaves among four people.

## Content
Division creates fractions, but fractions create division. This circular logic hints at something deep: fractions aren't just numbers, they're relationships.

3/4 means:
- Three parts of something divided into four
- Three divided by four
- The ratio of 3 to 4
- A point three-quarters along the unit interval

Fractions filled the gaps between integers, revealing that the number line isn't a series of stepping stones but a continuous bridge. Yet this continuity is deceptive - between any two fractions lies another, ad infinitum.

The Egyptians wrote fractions as sums of unit fractions (1/n). The Babylonians used base-60, giving us clean fractions for time. But it was the Indians who wrote fractions as we do: numerator over denominator, a number over a number.

Fractions obey strange rules:
- Multiply by flipping and multiplying (why?)
- Add by finding common ground
- Some reduce, others don't
- Some terminate as decimals, others repeat forever

Fractions revealed that not all divisions are equal: 1/3 can't be written exactly in decimal, hinting at the irrational numbers to come.
