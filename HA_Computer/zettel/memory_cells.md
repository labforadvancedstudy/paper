# Memory Cells

## Core Insight
A circuit that remembers - the smallest unit of electronic nostalgia.

A flip-flop: gates feeding back into themselves, creating a loop that holds a bit. Set it to 1, it stays 1. Set it to 0, it stays 0. Until you tell it otherwise. This is memory at its most primitive - not remembering experiences or faces, just remembering a single yes or no.

RAM cells do this with capacitors - tiny electrical buckets that hold charge. But the charge leaks, so we must refresh constantly. Even our machines forget without effort. Memory is active, not passive. Remembering requires energy.
