# Cosmic Dawn

## Core Insight
The universe's first stars ended the cosmic dark age - massive, metal-free giants that forged the first heavy elements and reionized space, transforming a dark universe into one filled with light.

After recombination at 380,000 years, the universe entered the "dark age" - no stars, just cooling gas and dark matter. Gravity slowly gathered primordial hydrogen into clumps. At ~100 million years, the first stars ignited. These Population III stars were monsters - 100-1000 solar masses, burning purely hydrogen and helium. No metals meant no cooling, requiring massive accumulation before collapse.

They lived fast and died young, perhaps only millions of years. But their impact was profound. Their intense UV radiation began reionizing neutral hydrogen, creating expanding bubbles of ionized gas. Their deaths as supernovae or direct collapse to black holes seeded space with the first metals. These ashes enabled Population II stars - smaller, longer-lived, capable of forming planets. We've never seen Population III stars directly - they're too distant and short-lived. But their signatures appear in ancient stars' compositions and the universe's reionization history. The cosmic dawn transformed a dark, simple universe into the complex, illuminated cosmos we inhabit.
