# Investment

## Core Insight
Planting seeds for future harvest: sacrificing present consumption for future abundance - economics as time travel.

Investment is hope made material. It's the bet that tomorrow can be better than today if we sacrifice now. Every investment is an act of faith in the future.

Investment types:
- **Real investment** - building productive capacity
- **Financial investment** - buying claims on future returns
- **Human investment** - education and training
- **R&D investment** - seeking new knowledge
- **Social investment** - building relationships

Investment characteristics:
- Risk (future is uncertain)
- Return (reward for risk)
- Time horizon (how long to wait)
- Liquidity (can I get out?)
- Diversification (don't put all eggs...)

The magic: investment compounds. A dollar invested becomes two, becomes four, becomes empire. This exponential growth is civilization's secret sauce.

Yet investment requires surplus - only those who have more than they need can invest. This creates a feedback loop: wealth enables investment enables more wealth. Breaking this cycle is economics' ethical challenge.
