# Gestalt Principles

The human brain automatically organizes visual elements into unified wholes rather than seeing individual parts. We perceive patterns, not pixels.

## Core Principles
- **Proximity**: Elements close together are seen as groups
- **Similarity**: Similar elements are perceived as related
- **Closure**: We complete incomplete shapes mentally
- **Continuity**: We see smooth, continuous paths
- **Figure-Ground**: We distinguish objects from backgrounds

## Example
When you see three dots arranged like âˆ´, you perceive a triangle rather than three separate points. Your brain creates connections that don't physically exist.
