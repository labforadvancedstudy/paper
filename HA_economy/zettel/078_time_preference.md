# Time Preference

## Core Insight
Time preference is the fundamental trade-off between present and future - why we discount tomorrow's pleasure and how that shapes everything from interest rates to civilization itself.

A bird in hand versus two in the bush. A marshmallow now or two in fifteen minutes. This isn't just impatience - it's a deep feature of consciousness existing in time. The present is certain, vivid, sensual. The future is abstract, uncertain, imaginary.

But time preference varies. Low time preference (valuing future highly) enables saving, investment, education, civilization building. High time preference (wanting now) drives consumption, debt, short-term thinking. Societies with low time preference build cathedrals. Those with high time preference struggle to maintain roads.

Interest rates are time preference made mathematical. Why does money today cost more than money tomorrow? Because humans prefer now to later. The interest rate is the price of time itself - the compensation required to make waiting worthwhile.

Culture shapes time preference. Protestant work ethic lowered it. Consumer culture raises it. Poverty raises it (when survival is uncertain, grab what you can). Wealth lowers it (when needs are met, you can plan).

The modern paradox: we've never been wealthier (should lower time preference) yet consumer debt explodes and climate change reveals civilizational short-termism. Have we hacked our own time preferences through advertising and easy credit?

Time preference might be humanity's most important variable - it determines whether we're building or consuming our future.
