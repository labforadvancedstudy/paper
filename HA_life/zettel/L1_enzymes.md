# Enzymes

## Core Insight
Life's speed demons - proteins that make impossible chemistry happen at body temperature by being molecular matchmakers.

Without enzymes, the chemical reactions in your body would take years, centuries, or never happen. A reaction that takes milliseconds with an enzyme might take a billion years without one. Enzymes make life possible by making the impossible probable.

How? They're shape-shifters. An enzyme grabs specific molecules (substrates), holds them in exactly the right position, strains their bonds just so, and makes reaction inevitable. Like a lock that changes shape to help the key turn.

The numbers are staggering. Catalase breaks down hydrogen peroxide at 40 million molecules per second. One enzyme, 40 million reactions. Without it, peroxide would slowly poison you. With it, harmless water and oxygen.

But enzymes are picky. Each recognizes only specific substrates - shape must match perfectly. Wrong pH, wrong temperature, wrong salt concentration? Enzyme changes shape and stops working. This pickiness is control - reactions happen only when conditions are right.
