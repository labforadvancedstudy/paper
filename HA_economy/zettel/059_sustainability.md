# Sustainability

## Core Insight
Sustainability is the collision between exponential economic growth and finite planetary boundaries - an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object.

For 200 years, economics assumed infinite resources and infinite waste sinks. Growth was god. But Earth is finite. There's only so much oil, so much atmosphere to dump carbon, so much ocean to acidify. We're discovering economics has been living in a larger system it ignored.

The math is stark. At 3% growth, an economy doubles every 23 years. In a century, it's 16 times larger. In two centuries, 256 times. Can we really have an economy 256 times today's size on one planet? Physics says no. Economics says yes. Something has to give.

But here's the complexity: billions still live in poverty. They need growth for basic dignity. Telling them to stop developing while rich nations enjoy abundance is both immoral and impossible. We need growth for the poor and degrowth for the rich simultaneously.

Enter the dream of decoupling - growing GDP while shrinking resource use. Some progress: rich nations' GDP grows while emissions flatten. But globally, every GDP dollar still means more materials extracted, more waste produced. Relative decoupling yes, absolute decoupling remains fantasy.

Sustainability forces economics to confront its deepest assumption: that more is always better. What's an economy for if not growth? Can prosperity exist without expansion? These aren't just policy questions - they're existential ones.
