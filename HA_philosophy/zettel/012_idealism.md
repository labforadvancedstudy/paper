# Idealism

## Core Insight
Only mind is real - matter is just persistent thoughts.

## The Inside-Out Universe

Berkeley's bombshell: that tree falling in the forest? Without perception, it doesn't exist. Esse est percipi - to be is to be perceived.

L1: Things vanish when I close eyes?
L2: God's mind sustains all
L3: Ideas are primary reality
L4: Mind constructs experience
L5: Consciousness is fundamental
L6: Observer creates reality
L7: All is interpretation
L8: Information is substrate
L9: Consciousness/matter dissolve

Quantum mechanics vindicated Berkeley? The observer collapses the wave function. Reality needs consciousness to become definite.
