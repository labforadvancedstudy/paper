# Optimization Theory

## Core Insight
Optimization is the mathematics of "good enough" - finding the best available solution in a universe where perfect is the enemy of possible.

Optimization reveals the hidden trade-offs in every system. Faster or cheaper? Reliable or flexible? Efficient or robust? The optimizer's curse: improving one dimension often degrades others. True optimization is navigating the multi-dimensional landscape of compromise.

The methods mirror the philosophy. Gradient descent: follow improvement locally. Genetic algorithms: evolve toward better. Simulated annealing: sometimes get worse to eventually get better. Each assumes different things about the shape of possible.

From route planning to neural network training: optimization is how we navigate complexity. It's admitting we can't examine every option, so we need clever ways to find good ones. Optimization is engineering's humility before infinity.
