# Creative Destruction

## Core Insight
Creative destruction is capitalism's dark heart - progress requires annihilation, innovation demands obsolescence, birth necessitates death.

Schumpeter saw what others missed: capitalism's essence isn't equilibrium but perpetual revolution. The entrepreneur isn't an optimizer but a destroyer. New doesn't just add to old - it obliterates it.

Consider the smartphone. It didn't just add a product category. It destroyed cameras, calculators, maps, newspapers, music players, and countless other industries. Millions of jobs vanished. Entire skill sets became worthless. Cities built on dead industries became rust belts.

The destruction is real suffering. The 50-year-old factory worker doesn't easily become a coder. The local newspaper doesn't smoothly transition to digital. Communities built around coal don't seamlessly switch to solar. Creative destruction sounds clean in theory. In practice, it's messy, painful, human wreckage.

Yet without destruction, no creation. Protecting film kills digital photography. Subsidizing typewriters prevents word processors. The attempt to save every job and industry leads to stagnation, then collapse. Ask the Soviet Union.

The paradox: we need creative destruction for progress, but it's accelerating beyond human adaptation speed. AI might be the ultimate creative destroyer - what if it destroys faster than it creates? What if the destruction includes us?

Creative destruction reveals capitalism's deepest truth: it's not a system of stability but of permanent revolution.
