# System Integration

## Core Insight
System integration is the art of making foreigners family - creating wholeness from parts that weren't designed to be whole, discovering emergent capabilities in unexpected combinations.

Integration is harder than design because you inherit assumptions. Each system speaks its own language, keeps its own time, expects its own environment. Integration is translation, negotiation, compromise - making peace between incompatible worldviews.

The magic: integrated systems do what no component imagined. GPS + phone + internet = navigation revolution. Camera + AI + network = surveillance state. Simple parts, profound wholes. Integration is civilization's multiplication table.

From supply chains to smart cities: integration defines modern capability. It's not about perfect parts but perfect connections. The skill is seeing how puzzle pieces from different puzzles might form new pictures.
