# Saving

## Core Insight
Not eating the marshmallow now to have two later - economics is conquered time.

The child who saves their Halloween candy discovers time's economic dimension. Saving is the first victory over immediate desire, the beginning of all investment, capital, and growth.

Saving teaches:
- **Delayed gratification** - future pleasure > present pleasure
- **Uncertainty** - will the saved thing still be there?
- **Compound effects** - saved seeds become orchards
- **Security** - buffer against future lack
- **Opportunity** - saved resources enable bigger trades

Watch a squirrel bury nuts. This isn't economics - it's instinct. Watch a child save allowance for a bigger toy. This IS economics - conscious time arbitrage.

The saver discovers:
- Present consumption has future cost
- Resources can work across time
- Patient beats impatient in the long run
- Security requires sacrifice
- The future is purchasable

Every bank account, every investment portfolio, every retirement fund - they all started with a child not eating their cookie immediately. Saving is humanity's rebellion against time's tyranny.
