# Banking System

## Core Insight
The money multiplier machine: where IOUs become currency and trust becomes liquidity - civilization's greatest magic trick.

Banks don't just store money - they create it. Through fractional reserve lending, banks transform $100 in deposits into $1000 in the economy. This multiplication of nothing into something powers modern growth.

Banking mechanics:
- **Fractional reserves** - lend out 90% of deposits
- **Money creation** - loans create new deposits
- **Maturity transformation** - borrow short, lend long
- **Risk pooling** - spread defaults across many
- **Payment systems** - money moves as information

Banking paradoxes:
- Banks create money from promises
- Confidence makes banks solid
- Doubt makes banks collapse
- Everyone can't withdraw at once
- System requires shared delusion

The profound truth: banking is institutionalized trust. It works because we believe it works. One bank failing is a business problem; all banks failing is civilizational collapse.

Modern evolution: central banks, digital money, cryptocurrency. Each tries to solve banking's core problem - how to create money without creating chaos.
