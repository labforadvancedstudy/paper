# Personal Space

## Core Insight
The invisible bubble around each person that creates the first boundary between self and society.

Every human carries an invisible force field. Step too close to a stranger and watch them step back - that's personal space in action. It's the most basic social rule we learn without being taught.

This bubble varies by culture (18 inches in the US, closer in Southern Europe, farther in Japan), relationship (lovers merge bubbles, strangers maintain distance), and context (crowded subway vs empty park).

Personal space is society's first lesson: you end where others begin.
