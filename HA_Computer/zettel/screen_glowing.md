# Screen Glowing

## Core Insight
Light organized into meaning - the computer's way of talking back to us.

A child sees the glow before understanding pixels. Just light, dancing, changing. Colors appearing from nowhere. Shapes forming and dissolving. It's magic until you learn about electrons exciting phosphors or liquid crystals twisting light. But even knowing the physics doesn't diminish the wonder: dead matter organizing photons into words, images, worlds.

The screen is our window into the computer's mind. Not through glass, but through light itself.
