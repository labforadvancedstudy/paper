# Scaffolding: Zone of Proximal Development

**Core Concept**: Learning happens best just beyond current ability, with temporary support.

## One-Line Definition
The sweet spot between "too easy" and "too hard" where growth occurs with help.

## Simple Mental Model
Like training wheels on a bike - support that's gradually removed as competence grows. Too much help = no learning. Too little = frustration.

## Key Mechanism
1. Assess current ability level
2. Present challenge slightly above
3. Provide minimal necessary support
4. Gradually withdraw assistance

## Practical Example
Teaching a child to tie shoes: First you do it while they watch. Then guide their hands. Then just verbal cues. Finally, they do it alone. Each step removes one support.

## Common Misconception
Good teaching means making things easy. Actually, optimal learning requires productive struggle - challenge with just enough support to succeed.
