# Bug

## Core Insight
A bug is the universe's way of showing the gap between what we think we told the computer and what we actually told it.

The term "bug" is beautifully honest - it acknowledges that errors creep into our systems like insects into machinery. Grace Hopper's moth was prophetic: bugs are unwanted visitors that somehow find their way in.

Every bug is a lesson in humility. It's proof that our mental model diverged from reality. The computer, in its perfect stupidity, did exactly what we said, not what we meant.

Bugs have personalities:
- The Heisenbug: disappears when you look for it
- The Bohrbug: solid, reproducible, findable
- The Mandelbug: chaotic, complex beyond comprehension
- The Schrodingbug: works until someone reads the code and realizes it shouldn't

Debugging is archaeology - digging through layers of assumptions to find where reality and intention diverged.
