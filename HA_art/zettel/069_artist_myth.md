# Artist Myth

## Core Insight
The romantic construction - where creators become shamans, sufferers, and seers, perpetuating myths that both elevate and constrain what it means to make art.

Persistent archetypes:
- Mad genius (Van Gogh)
- Suffering artist (starving)
- Divine inspiration (muse-driven)
- Outsider rebel (anti-social)
- Tortured soul (addiction/mental illness)

Myth functions:
- Explains creativity
- Justifies difficulty
- Romanticizes poverty
- Excuses behavior
- Creates mystique

Historical construction:
- Renaissance genius
- Romantic visionary
- Bohemian outsider
- Modern alienated
- Contemporary brand

Damage done:
- Mental health stigmatized
- Bad behavior excused
- Diversity excluded
- Labor hidden
- Success suspicious

Counter-narratives:
- Artist as worker
- Collective creation
- Healthy practices
- Community engagement
- Professional development

Gender/race/class exposed:
- White male default
- Others as exception
- Different myths applied
- Access assumptions
- Network advantages

Contemporary complications:
- Social media performance
- Brand building required
- Authenticity manufactured
- Success metrics visible
- Myths monetized

Yet something persists:
- Creation remains mysterious
- Inspiration feels real
- Difference valued
- Vision celebrated
- Magic hoped for

New myths emerging: Artist as entrepreneur, researcher, activist, influencer. Each generation creates artists it needs. Myths reveal more about society than art.
