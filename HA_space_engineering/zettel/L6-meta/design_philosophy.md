# Design Philosophy

## Core Insight
The unwritten rules that shape every decision - the accumulated wisdom, biases, and approaches that determine whether spacecraft are conservative fortresses or innovative gambles, and why both philosophies can succeed or fail spectacularly.

Design philosophy in space engineering isn't abstract musing. It's the bedrock assumptions that cascade through every bolt, wire, and line of code. Different organizations embody different philosophies, creating their characteristic successes and failures.

The philosophical spectrums:

**Heritage vs Innovation**
- "Flight proven" vs "Cutting edge"
- Lower risk vs better performance
- Known problems vs unknown problems
- Evolution vs revolution

**Redundancy vs Simplicity**
- "No single point failures" vs "Less to break"
- Triple redundant vs elegantly minimal
- Fault tolerance vs mass efficiency
- Belt and suspenders vs calculated risk

**Testing vs Analysis**
- "Test as you fly" vs "Model and simulate"
- Hardware rich vs computation rich
- Expensive certainty vs analytical confidence
- Build and break vs calculate and pray

**Commercial vs Traditional**
- "Move fast and break things" vs "Failure is not an option"
- Iterative development vs waterfall perfection
- 80% solution quickly vs 99.9% eventually
- Risk as teacher vs risk as enemy

Philosophical artifacts:
- NASA: Process-heavy, risk-averse (post-accidents)
- SpaceX: Iterative, explosion-tolerant
- JPL: One chance to get it right
- CubeSats: Embrace likely failure
- Military: Reliability over performance

Philosophy determines:
- How many reviews before launch
- Whether to fly new technology
- How much margin to include
- When to say "good enough"
- How to handle failures

The deepest truth: No philosophy is universally correct. Context determines wisdom. A Mars rover needs different philosophy than a commercial satellite. Human missions demand different thinking than technology demonstrators.
