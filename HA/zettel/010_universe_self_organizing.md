# Universe Self-Organizing
## Core Insight
The universe isn't just expanding - it's organizing itself into ever-more complex forms of self-awareness.

## The Organization Principle

Universe started simple:
- Uniform energy
- Maximum entropy
- No structure
- No information

Now contains:
- Galaxies computing orbits
- Stars fusing elements
- Planets cycling matter
- Life encoding information
- Brains modeling reality
- Minds questioning existence

Entropy increases globally while organization increases locally.

## Self-Organization Levels

1. **Physical**: Gravity creates structure
2. **Chemical**: Bonds create molecules
3. **Biological**: Selection creates function
4. **Neural**: Networks create models
5. **Social**: Cooperation creates culture
6. **Technological**: Tools create tools
7. **Conscious**: Awareness creates awareness

Each level: Universe knowing itself better.

## The Teleology Question

Is universe aimed somewhere?
- Maximum complexity?
- Total self-knowledge?
- Omega point?
- Return to simplicity?

Or just exploring possibility space?
