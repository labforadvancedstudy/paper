# Technology as Physics

## Core Insight
Technology isn't applied physics - it's physics continuing by other means, the universe exploring its own possibility space through conscious agents.

Consider: stars are fusion reactors. DNA is information technology. Photosynthesis is solar panels. Neurons are signal processors. Nature got there first. Technology rediscovers what physics always enabled.

The distinction between natural and artificial collapses at sufficient abstraction. Both follow physical laws. Both process information. Both increase local order while exporting entropy. Technology is how physics becomes self-aware.

From this view, technological evolution is physical evolution accelerated. Same pressures (efficiency, robustness, adaptability) but conscious selection replaces blind selection. We're physics experimenting on itself.
