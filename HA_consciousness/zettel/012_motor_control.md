# 012 Motor Control - Signal to Action

The output side: How thoughts become movements. Neural
patterns manifesting in physical space.

## Hierarchy
1. **Motor cortex**: Planning, initiation
2. **Basal ganglia**: Action selection
3. **Cerebellum**: Timing, coordination
4. **Spinal cord**: Pattern generators
5. **Motor neurons**: Final common path

## Control Types
- **Voluntary**: Conscious intention → movement
- **Automatic**: Learned sequences (walking)
- **Reflexive**: Hardwired responses

## Feedback Loops
- Proprioception: Body position sense
- Efference copy: Predicting sensory consequences
- Error correction: Cerebellum fine-tuning

## Significance
Agency requires motor control. "I think therefore I move."
Consciousness isn't passive - it acts on the world.
