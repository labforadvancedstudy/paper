# Decision Making

Choosing under uncertainty.

Dual systems:
- System 1: Fast, intuitive, emotional
- System 2: Slow, deliberate, logical

Heuristics:
- Satisficing: Good enough
- Maximizing: Best possible

Framing effects:
- 90% survival vs 10% death
- Same info, different choice

Decision fatigue: Limited resource.
Too many choices = paralysis.
