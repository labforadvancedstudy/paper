# Propaganda

## Core Insight
The engineering of consent - when communication transcends information to become transformation, reshaping not just what people think but how they think.

Propaganda isn't lies (though it may include them). It's the systematic creation of reality through repetition, emotion, and symbol. The most effective propaganda feels like truth because it becomes truth through collective belief.

Modern propaganda learned from advertising and psychology:
- Repeat until familiar (familiarity breeds truth)
- Bypass reason through emotion (feel, don't think)
- Create associations (flag = freedom, enemy = disease)
- Simplify complexity (us good, them bad)
- Provide identity (you are the hero of this story)

The genius of propaganda: it makes you want what it wants you to want. Not coercion but seduction. You don't feel manipulated - you feel awakened, empowered, enlightened. The best propaganda doesn't feel like propaganda at all.

Every society has propaganda, but calls it different names: education, advertising, public relations, consciousness raising, awareness campaigns. The techniques remain constant: emotional triggers, repetitive messages, simplified narratives, manufactured consensus.

In the digital age, propaganda evolves: micro-targeted, algorithm-amplified, peer-distributed. We become our own propagandists, sharing and reshaping messages until we can't remember their source.
