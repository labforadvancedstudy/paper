# 012_memory_formation_synaptic_plasticity

## The Physical Basis of Experience

Synaptic plasticity transforms nervous systems
from fixed circuits into learning machines -
experience literally reshapes the brain.

### The Fundamental Discovery
- Synapses strengthen with use
- Weaken with disuse
- "Neurons that fire together, wire together"
- The physical encoding of memory

### Mechanisms of Change
- Short-term: Modified neurotransmitter release
- Long-term: New protein synthesis
- Structural: New synaptic connections
- Each timescale serving different memory needs

### From Reflex to Reflection
Plasticity enables:
- Habituation (ignoring repeated stimuli)
- Sensitization (heightened responses)
- Classical conditioning
- The first learned behaviors

### The Bridge to Consciousness
Memory creates:
- Temporal continuity
- Personal history
- The self that persists through time
