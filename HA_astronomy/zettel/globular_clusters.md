# Globular Clusters

## Core Insight
Globular clusters are stellar time capsules - ancient spherical cities of hundreds of thousands of stars, orbiting galaxies like satellites, preserving conditions from the universe's youth.

These dense stellar spheres contain 100,000 to 1 million stars in volumes just 100 light-years across. Stars pack so densely that night skies from planets there would blaze with thousands of stars brighter than Venus. Mutual gravity creates the spherical shape. Core densities reach millions of stars per cubic parsec - collisions and close encounters are common.

Globular clusters are ancient, typically 12-13 billion years old, forming when the universe was young. They lack gas and dust - all consumed in that initial starburst. Their stars are metal-poor, formed before generations of supernovae enriched the universe. They're fossil remnants of galaxy formation. The Milky Way has ~150 globulars orbiting in a spherical halo. Omega Centauri, the largest, might be a stripped dwarf galaxy nucleus. Studying globulars constrains the universe's age - they can't be older than the cosmos itself. These stellar metropolises have witnessed almost all of cosmic history.
