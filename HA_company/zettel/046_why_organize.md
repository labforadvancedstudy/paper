# Why Organize

## Core Insight
The drive to organize into companies reflects something deeper than economics - perhaps a fundamental force in the universe toward increasing complexity and capability.

Why do humans compulsively create companies? Not just for survival - we survived millions of years without them. Not just for comfort - they often create more stress. The drive seems deeper: to build something beyond ourselves, to touch immortality through institution.

Perhaps organization is how universe explores its potential. Through companies, cosmos develops new capabilities: global coordination, massive computation, reality transformation. We're not just organizing for human purposes but serving cosmic tendency toward complexity.

Or perhaps companies are inevitable in any universe with: finite resources, specialized capabilities, and communication. The company form might be discovered, not invented - a natural structure like crystals or spirals, emerging wherever conditions allow.
