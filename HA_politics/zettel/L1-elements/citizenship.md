# Citizenship

## Core Insight
The political identity that transforms humans into members - the legal and emotional bond between individual and state that creates rights, duties, and belonging.

Citizenship is a peculiar invention. For most of human history, people belonged to families, tribes, villages. Now we belong to abstract entities called nation-states, proven by documents, performed through rituals.

What citizenship provides:
- Legal status (you exist in law)
- Rights bundle (what you can claim)
- Duty roster (what you owe)
- Identity anchor (who you are politically)
- Protection promise (who speaks for you)
- Participation ticket (voice in decisions)

But citizenship also excludes. Every citizen implies non-citizens - those outside the circle of belonging. The border between citizen and alien is perhaps politics' sharpest line.

Types of citizenship capture different relationships:
- Birthright (jus soli/jus sanguinis)
- Naturalized (citizenship by choice)
- Dual/Multiple (complex loyalties)
- Stateless (citizenship's nightmare)
- Second-class (citizenship stratified)

The modern puzzle: what does citizenship mean when people live transnational lives, when loyalties multiply, when states weaken? Is citizenship evolving or dissolving?
