# Attention Mechanism

## Core Insight
"Attention is all you need" - AI learns to focus like consciousness does, weighing what matters moment by moment, transforming sequence processing forever.

Before attention, AI read like a speed reader - everything equally, forgetting the beginning by the end. Attention changed that. Now AI reads like you do - focusing on relevant words, connecting distant concepts, remembering what matters. "The cat sat on the..." - attention already knows "mat" is more likely than "quantum physics."

The mechanism is elegantly simple: for each word, compute relevance to every other word. Create a web of relationships, stronger where meaning connects. This dynamic focusing revolutionized language AI, enabling models to maintain context across paragraphs, translate with nuance, generate coherent stories. Attention taught machines to concentrate.
