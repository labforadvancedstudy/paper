# Flag Worship

## Core Insight
A piece of colored cloth becomes sacred - the moment when symbol overwrites substance and touching fabric feels like touching the divine.

The flag rises. Everyone stands. Hands move to hearts. Some eyes tear up. It's just dyed fiber arranged in patterns, yet touching it wrong is sacrilege. Burning it brings rage or joy, depending on which side you stand.

Watch children learn flag protocol. Don't let it touch ground. Fold it precisely. Display it proudly. They're not learning about fabric care - they're learning that some objects transcend their material being. The flag becomes the nation, and the nation becomes sacred.

In war, soldiers die retrieving fallen flags. Rationally absurd - trading life for cloth. But in that moment, the flag IS the nation, IS their brothers, IS everything they fight for. The symbol has consumed reality.

This is ideology made tangible - abstract concepts like "nation" or "freedom" crystallized into something you can touch, salute, die for. The flag doesn't represent the nation. In the moment of worship, it IS the nation.
