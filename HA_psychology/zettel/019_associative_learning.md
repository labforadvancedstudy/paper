# Associative Learning

Connection formation.

Classical conditioning:
- Bell + Food = Salivation
- Bell alone = Salivation
- Automatic responses

Operant conditioning:
- Action → Consequence
- Reinforcement increases
- Punishment decreases

Learning principles:
- Contiguity: Close in time
- Contingency: Reliable relationship

Phobias, habits, skills.
All associative learning.
