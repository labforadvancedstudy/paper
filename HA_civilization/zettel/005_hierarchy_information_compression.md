# Hierarchy Information Compression

Flat organization: n² communication paths. Breaks at scale.
Hierarchy: n log n paths. Scales indefinitely.

Compression via:
- Leaders summarize groups
- Levels filter information
- Decisions cascade down
- Feedback bubbles up

Cost: Information loss at each level.
Benefit: Coordination at any scale.
