# Exoplanet Perspective

## Core Insight
Discovering thousands of alien solar systems shattered our assumptions - our orderly Solar System is the weird one, forcing us to reimagine what "normal" planetary systems look like.

Before 1995, we knew one planetary system and assumed all others would be similar: small rocks inside, gas giants outside, circular orbits, stable spacing. Then we found 51 Pegasi b - a Jupiter-mass planet orbiting closer than Mercury. Then more hot Jupiters. Then super-Earths (which don't exist here). Then planets orbiting binary stars. Then rogue planets with no stars. Then worlds that rain glass sideways.

Our Solar System turned out to be unusual. Most systems have different architectures - giants that migrated inward, chains of planets in resonances, wildly eccentric orbits. We lack the universe's most common planet type (super-Earths/mini-Neptunes). Our nice spacing is rare. Jupiter's position as protector rather than destroyer is special. Exoplanets taught humility - we thought we understood planetary systems by studying one example. Like deducing all of biology from a single butterfly.
