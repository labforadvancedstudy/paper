# Wallet

## Core Insight
A wallet is a portable sovereignty container - the physical boundary between your economic self and the world, holding not just money but identity, possibility, and power.

Feel the weight of a full wallet versus an empty one. It's not just leather and paper - it's potential energy in your pocket. The wallet is civilization's compromise: you can't carry all your possessions, but you can carry the power to acquire them. It's a security blanket for adults, proof that you belong in the economic world.

The wallet's psychology:
- Thickness equals security (even if it's just receipts)
- Lost wallet panic exceeds monetary value
- The ritual pat-check: still there, still okay
- Organization reflects personality
- Digital wallets lack the comfort of weight

A wallet is really a shrine to modern identity: driver's license (who you are), credit cards (what you can do), cash (immediate power), photos (what you love). Losing your wallet isn't just losing money - it's temporary economic death.
