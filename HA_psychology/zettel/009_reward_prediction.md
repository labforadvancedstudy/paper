# Reward Prediction

Dopamine: Not pleasure, but prediction error.

How it works:
- Expected reward: Baseline dopamine
- Better than expected: Dopamine spike
- Worse than expected: Dopamine drop

Learning signal:
Adjusts future predictions.

Addiction hijacks this:
- Drugs cause huge errors
- Brain keeps chasing
- Tolerance develops

Anticipation > Reward itself.
