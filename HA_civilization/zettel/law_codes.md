# Law Codes

## Core Insight
Law is violence made predictable - transforming chaotic revenge into systematic justice.

Before law: you kill my brother, I kill you, your brother kills me, endless blood feud. After law: you kill my brother, the state kills you, done. Same violence, but now it stops.

The genius of law isn't justice - it's predictability. Everyone knows the rules beforehand. You can plan. You can calculate. Is stealing that cow worth losing a hand? Law turns morality into economics.

But laws also create reality. When law says "this land is yours," it creates property from nothing. When law says "you two are married," it creates a bond that exists only in legal reality. Law is consensus reality with teeth.
