# Set Theory and the Universe of Mathematics

## Core Insight
Set theory provides the foundation for all mathematics by reducing everything to a single concept: collections and membership.

## Content
Cantor's radical idea: let's talk about collections as objects. A set is just a collection of things, and mathematics is the study of what happens when we take this seriously.

Basic operations mirror thought:
- Union: everything in either set
- Intersection: things in both sets
- Complement: everything not in the set
- Subset: one collection within another

But infinity changes everything:
- ℕ = {0, 1, 2, ...} - the natural numbers
- |Even numbers| = |ℕ| - same size!
- |ℝ| > |ℕ| - uncountably many reals
- Power set always bigger: |P(X)| > |X|

The axioms (ZFC) tame the wild west:
- Extensionality: sets equal if same elements
- Pairing: can form {a, b}
- Union: can combine sets
- Power set: set of all subsets exists
- Infinity: infinite sets exist
- Choice: can pick from infinite collections

Paradoxes forced precision:
- Russell's paradox killed naive set theory
- Axioms prevent sets that are "too big"
- Proper classes transcend sets
- Consistency remains unprovable

Set theory revealed that mathematics could be rebuilt from one idea: ∈ (membership).
