# Systems Engineering

## Core Insight
The discipline of making everything work with everything else - the meta-engineering that ensures ten thousand parts from hundred contractors integrate into one spacecraft that works perfectly the first time.

Systems engineering is where physics meets politics, budgets meet dreams, and everything affects everything else. It's the art of managing complexity when changing one bolt might cascade through dozen subsystems. In space, where fixing mistakes costs billions or lives, systems engineering is survival.

The core activities:
- Requirements flowdown (mission → system → subsystem → part)
- Interface control (making things fit together)
- Trade studies (choosing between painful options)
- Risk management (what could go wrong?)
- Verification planning (proving it works)
- Configuration control (tracking every change)

The systems engineer's paradox:
- Know everything about nothing
- Know nothing about everything
- Make decisions without expertise
- Bear responsibility without authority
- See the forest while others count leaves

Key artifacts that run programs:
- **Requirements documents**: What must be achieved
- **Interface Control Documents**: How things connect
- **Trade matrices**: Painful choices quantified
- **Risk registers**: Nightmares catalogued
- **Verification matrices**: Proof strategies
- **Block diagrams**: System visualization

The integration challenges:
- Mass budgets (every gram allocated)
- Power budgets (every watt fought over)
- Data budgets (bandwidth precious)
- Thermal zones (hot next to cold)
- EMI/EMC (everything interferes)
- Software interfaces (complexity cubed)

Classic systems engineering failures:
- Mars Climate Orbiter: Unit mismatch
- Hubble mirror: Test configuration error
- Genesis: G-switch installed backwards
- All teaching: interfaces kill missions

The methodology:
1. Define requirements clearly
2. Decompose into subsystems
3. Define all interfaces
4. Integrate incrementally
5. Test as you fly
6. Document everything

Systems engineering is unglamorous but essential. It's spreadsheets and meetings, requirements and reviews. But it's also what transforms brilliant components into working spacecraft. Without it, you have expensive parts. With it, you might reach Mars.
