# Psychological Reactance: Freedom Threat

**Core Concept**: Tell someone they can't do something and they immediately want to do it more.

## One-Line Definition
Threatened freedom triggers an automatic "you're not the boss of me" response.

## Simple Mental Model
Like a cat with a closed door - didn't care about that room until you closed access. Now it's the only room that matters.

## Key Mechanism
1. Perceive freedom threat
2. Experience reactance arousal
3. Motivation to restore freedom
4. Value forbidden option more

## Practical Example
"Don't think about pink elephants." Now pink elephants dominate your mind. Ban a book, sales soar. Forbid teenage love, it intensifies.

## Common Misconception
Reactance is just stubbornness. Actually, it's an automatic response to preserve autonomy - even happens when we restrict our own options.
