# Morphology
## Core Insight
The LEGO blocks of language - how meaningful units combine to build words.

## The Word Factory

Morphology reveals that words aren't atomic - they're molecules made of meaningful atoms (morphemes).

**English Example**:
- un-believe-able
- un- (not) + believe (core) + -able (can be)
- Three morphemes = one word

**Types of Morphemes**:
- **Free**: Can stand alone (dog, run, happy)
- **Bound**: Need attachment (-ing, -ed, un-, -ness)
- **Root**: Core meaning (believe, struct, ceive)
- **Affix**: Modifiers (prefix, suffix, infix)

**Morphological Processes**:
1. **Affixation**: pre-view, walk-ing
2. **Compounding**: black+board, fire+fighter
3. **Reduplication**: super-duper, bye-bye
4. **Internal change**: sing→sang, foot→feet
5. **Suppletion**: go→went, be→was

**Language Types by Morphology**:
- **Isolating**: Chinese (one morpheme per word)
- **Agglutinating**: Turkish (morphemes stack clearly)
- **Fusional**: Spanish (morphemes blend)
- **Polysynthetic**: Inuktitut (entire sentences in one word)
