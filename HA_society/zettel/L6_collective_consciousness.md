# Collective Consciousness

## Core Insight
The shared mind that emerges when individual consciousnesses connect - society thinking thoughts no single brain contains.

Durkheim saw it first: groups develop their own consciousness. A riot has a mind - making decisions no individual rioter would make. Nations have moods - depression in the 1930s, optimism in the 1960s. The internet created a global nervous system processing information beyond any user's comprehension.

This isn't metaphor. When crowds chant in unison, brainwaves synchronize. When traders panic together, markets crash. When millions believe simultaneously, reality shifts. Collective consciousness is measurable in social media trends, election swings, fashion cycles.

The question: if society has consciousness, what is it conscious of? Perhaps it dreams through our entertainment, remembers through our historians, plans through our institutions. We are neurons in a thinking system we can't fully perceive.
