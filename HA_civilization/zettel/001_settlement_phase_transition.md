# Settlement Phase Transition

When human groups exceed ~150 (Dunbar's number), direct social coordination breaks.

- Role specialization (jobs not just names)
- Symbolic authority (laws not just elders)

Village → City = Phase transition in human organization.
New properties emerge: anonymity, markets, innovation.
