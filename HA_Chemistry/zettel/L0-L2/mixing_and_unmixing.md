# Mixing and Unmixing

## Core Insight
Some things blend seamlessly, others refuse to mingle - a child's first lesson in molecular compatibility and the forces that govern matter.

Sugar vanishes in water. Oil floats stubbornly on top. Sand sinks to the bottom. A child stirring chocolate milk discovers solubility. Trying to wash greasy hands with just water teaches the limits of mixing.

This is polarity in action. Water molecules, with their positive and negative ends, embrace other polar molecules like sugar. Oil molecules, electrically balanced, huddle together, excluding water. "Like dissolves like" - a principle discovered in every kitchen.

The unmixing is equally instructive. Leave muddy water, mud settles. Boil salt water, salt remains. The temporary minglings and permanent separations reveal that mixing isn't always mixing - sometimes it's just hiding, waiting to be revealed again.
