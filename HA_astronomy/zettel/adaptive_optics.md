# Adaptive Optics

## Core Insight
By deforming mirrors thousands of times per second to cancel atmospheric turbulence, we give ground telescopes space telescope clarity - turning twinkling from astronomy's enemy into a solved problem.

Stars twinkle because Earth's atmosphere acts like a turbulent lens, constantly bending light paths. This atmospheric seeing limited ground telescopes for centuries. Adaptive optics fights back in real-time. A laser creates an artificial guide star in the upper atmosphere. Sensors measure how atmospheric turbulence distorts this star's image. A deformable mirror adjusts its shape up to 2000 times per second, canceling the distortion.

The results are revolutionary. Ground telescopes now rival or exceed space telescopes in resolution (though not in wavelength coverage). We can study exoplanets, galactic centers, and distant galaxies with unprecedented detail. The technology, developed for military applications, transformed astronomy. What seemed a fundamental limitation - Earth's atmosphere - became a solved engineering problem. Sometimes the best way to space is staying on the ground with better tricks.
