# Mysticism

## Core Insight
Direct knowing of ultimate reality through experience beyond concepts - where religion stops talking and starts tasting.

Mysticism cuts through all mediation. No priest, no book, no building stands between mystic and Mystery. The claim is audacious: direct contact with divine/absolute/ultimate possible. Not through belief but through experience.

Mystical markers across traditions:
- **Ineffability** - can't be adequately expressed
- **Noetic quality** - knowledge gained, not just feeling
- **Transiency** - doesn't last (usually)
- **Passivity** - happens to you, not achieved
- **Unity** - subject/object distinction dissolves

The mystical paradox: must use words to point beyond words. Every mystic becomes poet, metaphor-maker, stammering at the unsayable:
- "God is best known by not knowing" (Eckhart)
- "The Tao that can be spoken is not the true Tao" (Laozi)
- "I am That" (Vedanta)
- "Form is emptiness, emptiness is form" (Buddhism)

Traditions split on mysticism:
- Embrace it (Sufism, Kabbalah, Christian mysticism)
- Suspect it (threatens authority, orthodoxy)
- Institutionalize it (meditation techniques, stages)

The critical question: delusion or deepest truth? Brain malfunction or proper function? The mystic doesn't care - the experience self-validates. But communities must decide: prophet or psychotic?
