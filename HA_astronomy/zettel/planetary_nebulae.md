# Planetary Nebulae

## Core Insight
Dying stars blow iridescent bubbles in space - planetary nebulae are stellar ghosts, glowing shells of gas illuminated by the white dwarf corpses of sun-like stars.

Despite their name, planetary nebulae have nothing to do with planets. William Herschel named them for their round, greenish appearance in small telescopes. They're actually the final exhalations of dying stars. When sun-like stars exhaust nuclear fuel, they puff off outer layers while the core contracts to a white dwarf. The expelled gas, moving at 20-30 km/s, forms expanding shells.

The white dwarf's intense ultraviolet radiation ionizes this gas, causing it to fluoresce in brilliant colors. Hydrogen glows red, oxygen green-blue, creating cosmic art. Complex shapes arise from magnetic fields, binary companions, and rotation - hourglasses, butterflies, rings. Each nebula is unique, shaped by its star's particular death throes. They last only ~10,000 years before fading. The Helix Nebula, Ring Nebula, and Cat's Eye show our Sun's future. In 5 billion years, Earth will be inside our Sun's planetary nebula - if it survives the red giant phase. Beauty from stellar death.
