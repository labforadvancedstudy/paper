# Empathy: Emotional Contagion

**Core Concept**: Emotions spread between people like viruses, automatically and unconsciously.

## One-Line Definition
You "catch" the emotions of those around you through unconscious mimicry and mirror neurons.

## Simple Mental Model
Like yawning - see someone yawn, you yawn. See someone cry, your eyes water. It's emotional WiFi.

## Key Mechanism
1. Perceive emotional expression
2. Automatically mimic micro-expressions
3. Facial feedback triggers same emotion
4. Experience "caught" emotion

## Practical Example
Walking into a tense meeting room, you immediately feel anxious even before anyone speaks. The stiff postures and furrowed brows have already infected your nervous system.

## Common Misconception
Emotional contagion requires conscious empathy. Actually, it happens faster than thought - you feel before you understand why.
