# Institutional Economics

## Core Insight
Institutional economics recognizes that markets don't exist in a vacuum - they're embedded in webs of rules, norms, and organizations that shape every transaction.

Douglas North put it simply: institutions are the rules of the game, organizations are the players. But it's the rules that determine whether you get North Korea or South Korea, despite identical geography and culture.

Institutions include formal rules (laws, property rights, constitutions) and informal ones (customs, trust, business culture). They're the invisible infrastructure of economics. You don't notice good institutions, like you don't notice oxygen - until they're gone.

Why do some societies develop growth-enhancing institutions while others get stuck with extractive ones? Path dependence provides clues. Small historical accidents - who colonized whom, which legal system was adopted, how land was distributed - echo through centuries.

Consider contract enforcement. In societies with strong courts, complex business blooms. Where courts are corrupt, business stays simple, local, family-based. The institution shapes the entire economic structure.

But institutions aren't just constraints - they're also resources. Silicon Valley's culture of failure acceptance is an institution that enables innovation. German apprenticeship systems are institutions that create skilled workers.

The hardest question: how do you change bad institutions? They're self-reinforcing. Those who benefit from bad rules use their power to maintain them. Development isn't just about capital or technology - it's about institutional evolution.
