# Free Will

## Core Insight
The experience of choice in a universe of causes - freedom's paradox.

## The Puppet Who Thinks It Pulls Its Strings

You feel free when choosing coffee over tea. But your brain decided 300ms before "you" did. Your choice was determined by neurons, which were determined by chemistry, which was determined by physics, which was determined by the Big Bang.

L1: I do what I want
L2: God gave us free will
L3: Reason can overcome passion
L4: Will is autonomous
L5: Freedom is authenticity
L6: Free will is a language game
L7: "Freedom" serves power structures
L8: Deterministic but unpredictable
L9: The question is malformed

Compatibilists say you're free if you do what you want. But what determines what you want?
