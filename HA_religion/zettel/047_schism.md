# Schism

## Core Insight
When one religion becomes two - the violent birth of diversity through disagreement, revealing that unity was always more fragile than it appeared.

Schisms start small: interpretation differs, practice varies, authority questioned. Then cascade: sides form, positions harden, communion breaks. Finally: anathemas pronounced, new traditions born, centuries of separation.

Famous fractures:
- **Christianity**: East/West (1054), Catholic/Protestant (1517)
- **Islam**: Sunni/Shia (632)
- **Buddhism**: Theravada/Mahayana (~100 BCE)
- **Judaism**: Orthodox/Reform/Conservative (1800s)

The patterns repeat:
- **Doctrinal**: How many natures in Christ?
- **Authority**: Who speaks for God?
- **Practice**: How should we worship?
- **Cultural**: Old ways vs new context
- **Personal**: Power struggles clothed in theology

Schisms reveal religion's paradox: claiming universal truth yet fragmenting endlessly. Each fragment insists it preserves authentic tradition. Each sees others as corruption.

But schisms also create: diversity, innovation, local adaptation. Without Protestant schism, no denominational variety. Without Buddhist splits, no Zen. Division enables evolution.

The irony: religions preaching unity excel at division. The tragedy: love of God becomes excuse for hatred of brother. The hope: even bitter schisms sometimes heal, centuries later, when original wounds are forgotten and common ground rediscovered.

Schism is religion's cell division - painful, necessary, creating new life from one.
