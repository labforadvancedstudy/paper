# Archaeoastronomy

## Core Insight
Ancient monuments encode astronomical knowledge in stone - our ancestors were sophisticated observers who built computers from megaliths and aligned civilizations with the cosmos.

Stonehenge isn't just a stone circle - it's an astronomical calculator. The heel stone marks summer solstice sunrise. The station stones create a rectangle with sides pointing to extreme Moon positions. Similar monuments worldwide show ancient astronomical sophistication. Chichen Itza's pyramid creates shadow serpents at equinoxes. Angkor Wat aligns with solstices and models precession.

Archaeoastronomy reveals how deeply astronomy shaped ancient cultures. Egyptian pyramids align with cardinal directions to 0.05 degrees. Medicine wheels mark star rises. Nazca lines point to celestial events. These weren't primitive attempts but precise observations encoded permanently. Ancient astronomers tracked precession, predicted eclipses, and discovered cycles we've only recently understood. They lacked telescopes but had something we don't - generations of continuous observation and cultural memory. Monuments are their data storage, surviving longer than any modern medium. In stone alignments, we read our ancestors' understanding of the cosmos.
