# Motivation Hierarchy

Maslow's pyramid (revised):

Base needs:
- Physiological: Food, water, shelter
- Safety: Security, stability
- Love/belonging: Connection, acceptance

Growth needs:
- Esteem: Recognition, achievement  
- Self-actualization: Potential fulfillment
- Self-transcendence: Beyond self

Not rigid hierarchy.
Culture matters.
Can skip levels.

Deficiency vs growth motivation.
