# Functions as Mappings

## Core Insight
A function is a machine that consistently transforms inputs into outputs - mathematics' way of capturing cause and effect.

## Content
Before functions were formalized, they were felt: "If I drop a ball from height h, it takes time t to fall." The relationship between h and t isn't arbitrary - it follows a rule. Functions capture these rules.

A function f: X → Y means:
- Every input in X produces exactly one output in Y
- Same input always gives same output
- The process is deterministic

But this simple idea explodes into richness:
- f(x) = x² (squaring function)
- f(x) = sin(x) (oscillation)
- f(x) = eˣ (exponential growth)
- f(x,y) = x² + y² (multiple inputs)

Functions revealed that mathematics isn't just about numbers - it's about relationships:
- Linear functions → straight lines → constant rate of change
- Polynomial functions → curves → varying rates
- Trigonometric functions → circles → periodicity
- Exponential functions → growth → compound effects

The function concept evolved:
- Functions of functions (composition)
- Functions that output functions (operators)
- Functions defined by differential equations
- Functions that can't be written down

Functions are the verbs of mathematics - they make things happen.
