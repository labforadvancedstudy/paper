# Oort Cloud

## Core Insight
A trillion icy bodies form a spherical shell around our Solar System - the ultimate frontier where the Sun's gravity barely holds court and comets sleep for millions of years.

The Oort Cloud exists at the edge of imagination. Starting perhaps 2,000 times Earth's distance from the Sun and extending halfway to the nearest star, it's a sparse sphere of ice and rock. Objects here orbit so slowly that one circuit might take millions of years. The Sun is just the brightest star in their sky. This is where long-period comets originate - nudged by passing stars into falling toward the Sun.

We've never seen the Oort Cloud directly; it's too far, too dark, too sparse. We infer its existence from comets that arrive from all directions, on orbits that stretch to infinity. It's the Solar System's halo, containing perhaps more mass than the Kuiper Belt but spread through vastly more space. In the Oort Cloud, our Solar System meets interstellar space, and the Sun's influence fades into the cosmic background.
