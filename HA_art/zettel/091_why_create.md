# Why Create

## Core Insight
The ultimate question: why do humans make things that serve no survival purpose? The answer reveals what consciousness is for.

Every culture creates art. No exceptions. Find humans, find mark-making, pattern-creating, beauty-seeking. But why? Art doesn't feed us, shelter us, protect us from predators. Yet we can't not do it.

Possible answers multiply:
- **Communication**: But we have language
- **Attraction**: But peacocks don't paint
- **Play**: But why this kind?
- **Status**: But anonymous art exists
- **Religion**: But secular art thrives
- **Therapy**: But happy people create too

Deeper possibility: consciousness creates because consciousness IS creation. We're not beings who happen to make art. We're the universe's way of making art. Through us, cosmos decorates itself, contemplates itself, celebrates itself.

Consider: universe spent 13.8 billion years evolving creatures who would:
- Arrange flowers just so
- Spend years perfecting brush strokes
- Die for beautiful ideas
- Weep at sunset colors
- Fill caves with painted animals

Why? Unless beauty is as fundamental as gravity. Unless creation is what consciousness does when it recognizes itself. Unless art is universe saying "I am, and it's wonderful."

We create because we must. Because not creating is spiritual death. Because the blank canvas is unbearable. Because beauty breaks us open and we leak art.
