# L2: Techniques and Traditions - How We Make

*The accumulated wisdom of hand and eye: where raw impulse meets craft knowledge*

> "I have learned that what I have not drawn, I have never really seen." - Frederick Franck

## The Bridge Between Impulse and Art

At L0, we felt the urge to make marks. At L1, we learned what marks could be - line, shape, color. Now at L2, we discover HOW. This is where desire meets discipline, where "I want to" meets "here's how."

Every culture develops techniques. Every generation inherits and transforms them. This is the level of craft - not yet art perhaps, but the essential foundation without which art remains trapped in the head.

## Drawing: Thinking in Line

Drawing is seeing slowed down. It's the most direct path from eye through hand to surface. No color to seduce, no mass to impress - just line describing world.

### The Foundation Skill

Why does every art education begin with drawing?
- Trains eye-hand coordination
- Builds seeing muscles
- Cheapest to practice
- Mistakes teach immediately
- Foundation for everything else

Even sculptors draw. Even video artists draw. Even if badly. Because drawing is visual thinking made visible.

### Core Drawing Techniques

**Contour Drawing**
- Follow edges with eyes
- Hand moves with eyes
- Don't look at paper
- Trust the connection
- Builds true seeing

Try it: Draw your hand without looking at paper. Disaster? Look again. See how much truth is in those wandering lines?

**Gesture Drawing**
- Capture energy not appearance
- 30 seconds per pose
- Find the movement
- Feel the force
- Life over accuracy

The model moves, you panic, lines fly. But somehow those panicked marks contain more life than careful rendering.

**Value Drawing**
- Light and shadow
- Create form with tone
- No lines in nature
- Modeling reality
- 2D becomes 3D

Squint. See the world as light/dark patterns. Draw those patterns. Watch flat paper gain depth.

**Perspective Drawing**
- Mathematical seeing
- Vanishing points
- Horizon lines
- Spatial illusion
- Renaissance magic

One-point, two-point, three-point. Suddenly you can build worlds that feel real. Power and limitation.

### Drawing Materials Speak

**Pencil**
- Control and precision
- Erasable (forgiveness)
- Range of values
- Sharp to soft
- Democratic tool

**Charcoal**
- Primal and immediate
- Messy truth
- Bold statements
- Atmospheric effects
- Connects to cave paintings

**Ink**
- No going back
- Confidence required
- Line quality matters
- Eastern traditions
- Permanent marks

**Digital**
- Infinite undo
- Layer thinking
- Perfect circles
- Pressure sensitivity?
- New possibilities

Each tool thinks differently. Pencil is careful. Charcoal is bold. Ink is decisive. Digital is... everything?

### The Drawing Traditions

**Western Academic**
- Careful observation
- Build from structure
- Anatomy matters
- Light describes form
- Realism as goal

**Eastern Calligraphic**
- Energy over appearance
- Breath in line
- Essence not surface
- Minimal marks
- Spirit through simplicity

**Cartoon/Illustration**
- Communication clarity
- Exaggeration serves
- Symbol over realism
- Readable quickly
- Pop culture power

**Experimental/Contemporary**
- Question everything
- Materials expand
- Process as content
- Drawing in space
- What isn't drawing?

## Painting: Thinking in Color

If drawing is bone, painting is flesh. Color seduces, overwhelms, speaks directly to emotion. No wonder painting was often suspected - too much power, too much pleasure.

### The Color Journey

**Local Color Phase**
- Apple is red
- Sky is blue
- Grass is green
- Match what you "know"
- Child's certainty

**Observational Phase**
- Apple has green shadows
- Sky contains yellow
- Grass reflects sky
- See what's there
- First confusion

**Interpretive Phase**
- Apple can be purple
- Sky can be orange
- Grass can be blue
- Color serves expression
- Freedom arrives

**Mastery Phase**
- Know all options
- Choose consciously
- Color as language
- Infinite subtlety
- Speak fluently

### Paint Behaviors

**Oil Paint**
- Slow drying (time to think)
- Rich colors (jewel-like)
- Blend forever (transitions)
- Layer possibilities (glazing)
- Toxic beauty (ventilation needed)
- Historical weight (masters used this)

**Acrylic Paint**
- Fast drying (decisive)
- Plastic clarity (modern)
- Water cleanup (accessible)
- Permanent (no cracking)
- Any surface (versatile)
- Democratic medium (anyone can)

**Watercolor**
- Transparency rules (light through)
- No white paint (paper shows)
- Can't hide mistakes (honesty)
- Flow and bleed (accept accidents)
- Portable (paint anywhere)
- Immediate (catch the moment)

**Digital Paint**
- No physical substance (light only)
- Infinite color (beyond eye)
- Perfect repeatability (exact match)
- Layers without weight (stack forever)
- Undo everything (fearless)
- Question: Is it painting?

### Painting Techniques

**Alla Prima (Direct)**
- Wet into wet
- One session
- Fresh and immediate
- No overthinking
- Impressionist favorite

**Glazing (Indirect)**
- Thin layers
- Build slowly
- Luminous depth
- Patience required
- Old Master method

**Impasto (Thick)**
- Paint as sculpture
- Texture speaks
- Light catches edges
- Physical presence
- Van Gogh energy

**Wet on Wet**
- Colors blend on canvas
- Soft transitions
- Happy accidents
- Speed required

### Color Mixing Wisdom

**Subtractive (Paint)**
- Start light, go dark
- Mud happens fast
- Less is more
- Know your pigments
- Chemistry matters

**Additive (Light)**
- RGB thinking
- Screen colors
- Brighter mixing
- Different rules
- Future dominant?

**Temperature Control**
- Warm advances
- Cool recedes
- Opposition vibrates
- Harmony soothes
- Emotion through heat

## Sculpture: Thinking in Space

Painting stops at surface. Sculpture enters the room with you. It occupies space, casts shadows, changes with viewpoint. It's art you can walk around, sometimes touch, always confront physically.

### Addition vs. Subtraction

**Additive (Modeling)**
- Clay building
- Wax forming
- Assemblage
- 3D printing
- Create from nothing
- Godlike act

Start with nothing, create something. The primal joy of forming matter. Clay between fingers, responsive, forgiving. Build, destroy, rebuild.

**Subtractive (Carving)**
- Stone cutting
- Wood carving
- Finding form within
- No going back
- Release the trapped
- Michelangelo vision

The form already exists in stone. Your job is to remove excess. Every chip is decision. Mistakes are forever. Terror and revelation.

**Assemblage (Found)**
- Readymades
- Combination
- Context shift
- Duchamp legacy
- Question everything
- Democracy of objects

That urinal isn't sculpture. Place it in gallery, sign it, and... is it? Found objects assembled create new meanings. Everything is material.

### Materials Speak Volumes

## Photography: Thinking in Light

The democratic revolution. Suddenly, anyone could capture reality. No years of training. Just: point, click, image. But ease of capture made art harder - when everyone can record, how do you see?

### The Photographer's Eye

**Framing**
- What to include
- More important: exclude
- World is chaos
- Find order
- Rectangle rules

**Timing**
- Decisive moment
- Before/after wrong
- Patience hunter
- Luck + preparation
- Time collapsed

**Light Quality**
- Golden hour
- Harsh noon
- Soft overcast
- Direction matters
- Light is subject

**Composition**
- Rule of thirds

### Technical Trinity

**Aperture (f-stop)**
- Size of opening
- Depth of field

- Isolation tool
- Creative control

**Shutter Speed**
- Time captured
- Freeze/blur
- Motion revealed
- Handshake visible
- Moment's duration

**ISO (Sensitivity)**
- Light gathering

- Always return to why

## The Practice Path

### Beginner Mind
- Everything is new
- Mistakes are teachers
- Joy in discovery
- No style yet
- Open to all

### Frustration Phase
- Vision exceeds ability
- Comparing to masters
- Want to quit
- Push through
- Character building

### Competence Emerging
- Tools obey sometimes
- Small victories
- Personal voice hints
- Confidence builds
- Path clarifies

### Flow States
- Tool disappears
- Time vanishes
- Vision = execution
- Joy returns
- Why we continue

### Mastery/Return
- Could do it sleeping
- Seek new challenges
- Teach others
- Remember beginning
- Circle completes

## Your Assignment

Choose ONE technique from any tradition:
1. Practice daily for one week
2. Document progress
3. Note frustrations
4. Celebrate breakthroughs
5. Share with someone

Technique isn't the goal. It's the vehicle. But without vehicle, journey remains dream.

## The Synthesis

All techniques are thinking made visible:
- Drawing thinks in line
- Painting thinks in color
- Sculpture thinks in space
- Photography thinks in light
- Digital thinks in possibility

Master one deeply. Taste all curiously. Find where your thinking fits.

Remember: Every master was terrible once. Every tradition was innovation once. Every technique was breakthrough once.

Now pick up your tool. Make something bad. Make it again, slightly better. Repeat for life.

This is L2. Where desire learns discipline. Where vision finds vehicle. Where you discover that freedom comes through, not around, limitation.

*"In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's there are few." - Shunryu Suzuki*

## The Encouragement

Frustrated? Good. That means you're learning.
Comparing yourself to masters? Stop. Compare to yesterday's you.
Want to skip technique and just express? Try it. See why technique helps.
Think you'll never be good enough? Define "enough."

The universe waited 13.8 billion years for you to pick up this [brush/camera/chisel/stylus].
Don't keep it waiting.
