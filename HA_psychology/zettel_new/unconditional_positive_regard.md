# Unconditional Positive Regard

Carl Rogers' radical idea: accepting and valuing someone regardless of their behavior. Love the person, not the performance.

## Core Concept
Separating the person's worth from their actions. "I accept you as you are, not as I want you to be."

## In Therapy
- No judgment of client's thoughts/feelings
- Genuine warmth and acceptance
- Creating safe space for exploration
- Believing in client's growth potential

## The Paradox of Change
By accepting people as they are, we create the conditions for them to change. Conditional love creates facades; unconditional regard allows authenticity.

## Challenges
- Doesn't mean approving all behavior
- Hard with destructive actions
- Cultural variations in expression
- Risk of enabling

## Impact
- Builds genuine self-esteem
- Reduces defensive behaviors
- Enables vulnerability
- Facilitates growth
