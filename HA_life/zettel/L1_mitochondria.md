# Mitochondria

## Core Insight
Ancient bacteria that became our power plants - the most successful corporate merger in history.

Two billion years ago, a cell swallowed a bacterium but didn't digest it. Best. Mistake. Ever. That bacterium became mitochondria, and that merger created all complex life.

They still look like bacteria - oval, with their own membrane, even their own DNA (37 genes in humans). They reproduce by dividing like bacteria. But they've forgotten how to live alone. We've forgotten how to live without them.

The numbers: you have about 10 million billion mitochondria. They make up 10% of your body weight. Each cell (except red blood cells) has hundreds to thousands. Muscle cells can have 5000 each.

They're not just power plants - they're cellular decision makers. When a cell should die? Mitochondria decide. How fast you age? Largely mitochondrial. Your mother's mitochondria became yours - paternal mitochondria are destroyed after fertilization.
