# Oligarchy

## Core Insight
Rule by few - the system where a small group controls political power, whether through wealth, military force, party membership, or other exclusive criteria.

Oligarchy is perhaps politics' most honest form. It drops the pretense that everyone rules (democracy) or that one rules (autocracy). Instead: we few rule, you many obey. Simple. Clear. Brutal.

Historical oligarchies wore their exclusion proudly:
- Sparta's warrior elite
- Venice's merchant families
- Rome's patrician class
- Soviet Union's party nomenklatura
- Corporate boards everywhere

Modern oligarchies hide better:
- Behind democratic facades
- Within party structures
- Through economic domination
- Via technocratic expertise
- Through network effects

The iron law of oligarchy (per Robert Michels): every organization, no matter how democratic its intentions, tends toward oligarchic control. The active few always dominate the passive many.

Why oligarchy persists:
- Coordination advantages (few decide faster)
- Resource concentration (power attracts wealth attracts power)
- Information asymmetry (insiders know more)
- Apathy of masses (most don't want to rule)
- Complexity of governance (expertise concentrates)

The oligarchic tension: too few rulers and revolution threatens. Too many and decisiveness disappears. Successful oligarchies expand just enough to prevent explosion while maintaining control.
