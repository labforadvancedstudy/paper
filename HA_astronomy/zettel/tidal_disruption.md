# Tidal Disruption Events

## Core Insight
When stars venture too close to supermassive black holes, they're torn apart by tidal forces - creating months-long flares that illuminate dormant galactic centers and reveal hidden monsters.

Every galaxy harbors a central supermassive black hole, mostly quiescent after their quasar phase. But occasionally, a star's orbit brings it within the tidal radius where the black hole's gravity gradient overcomes stellar self-gravity. The star stretches into a stream, half falling into the black hole, half escaping. The infalling material forms an accretion disk, heating to millions of degrees and radiating across the spectrum.

These tidal disruption events (TDEs) create unique light curves - rapid rise as material falls in, power-law decay as accretion slows. They're cosmic autopsies, revealing stellar composition through spectroscopy of the debris. TDEs also probe black hole properties - mass from tidal radius, spin from disk dynamics. They illuminate galactic nuclei, showing gas dynamics normally invisible. About one TDE per galaxy per 10,000 years makes them rare but detectable with surveys. Each event is a star's spectacular death, briefly outshining its entire galaxy.
