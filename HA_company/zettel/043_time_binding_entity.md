# Time Binding Entity

## Core Insight
Companies bind time - connecting past learning to future possibility through present action, creating continuity that transcends human lifespans.

Humans live ~80 years. Companies can live centuries. This temporal transcendence lets companies undertake projects no individual could complete. Cathedrals took generations. Modern companies build equivalent complexity through accumulated effort over time.

Companies are time machines. They store past (institutional memory), operate present (current activities), create future (R&D, investment). Knowledge accumulates. Capabilities compound. What founding generation begins, future generations complete. Time becomes resource.

But time binding requires active maintenance. Culture must transmit. Knowledge must transfer. Purpose must persist. Without conscious cultivation, corporate amnesia sets in. The company forgets why it exists, repeats past mistakes, loses future vision. Time binding is work.
