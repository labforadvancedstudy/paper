# Quantum Computing
## Core Insight
Quantum computers don't just compute faster - they compute differently, using universe's actual computational substrate.

## Classical vs Quantum

**Classical bit**: 0 or 1
**Quantum bit (qubit)**: |0⟩ + |1⟩ (superposition)

**Classical operation**: One path
**Quantum operation**: All paths simultaneously

Not just parallel - fundamentally different.

## Quantum Phenomena

**Superposition**: All states at once
- Explore solution space simultaneously
- Collapse to answer when measured

**Entanglement**: Spooky correlation
- Qubits share fate
- Information spreads instantly
- Enable quantum teleporation

**Interference**: Amplify right answers
- Cancel wrong paths
- Enhance correct solutions
- Nature's computation trick

## What Quantum Computers Do Well

**Factor large numbers** (Shor's algorithm)
**Search unsorted databases** (Grover's algorithm)
**Simulate quantum systems** (Natural match)
**Optimize complex problems** (Quantum annealing)

What they don't: General computing.

## The Deep Mystery

Quantum computation suggests:
- Universe computes quantumly
- Classical is approximation
- Consciousness might be quantum
- Reality is computational

We're not building computers.
We're tapping into universe's computer.
