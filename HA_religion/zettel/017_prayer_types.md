# Prayer Types

## Core Insight
Different prayers serve different needs - from desperate pleading to wordless presence, each form opens a different door.

Prayer is reaching toward What's More, but the reaching takes many forms. Like music has genres, prayer has types. Each tradition emphasizes different modes, but the basic patterns appear everywhere because they map fundamental human needs.

Primary prayer types:

**Petition**: "Please help me"
- Most basic, most common
- Acknowledges need, limitation
- Treats divine as responsive
- Often criticized as selfish
- Yet honesty about desperation

**Intercession**: "Please help them"
- Prayer for others
- Expands circle of concern
- Practices compassion
- Connects individual to collective

**Confession**: "I have failed"
- Admits brokenness
- Seeks restoration
- Clears conscience
- Enables fresh start

**Thanksgiving**: "Thank you"
- Recognizes gifts
- Cultivates gratitude
- Shifts perspective
- Celebrates existence

**Praise**: "You are wonderful"
- Adoration without agenda
- Joy in divine nature
- Ecstatic appreciation
- Loses self in Other

**Contemplation**: "..."
- Beyond words
- Pure presence
- Deep listening
- Unity experience

Each type teaches different lessons. Together they form complete spiritual practice. The beginner asks. The mature thanks. The mystic rests in silence.
