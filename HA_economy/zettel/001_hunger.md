# Hunger

## Core Insight
The empty stomach is economics' first teacher - scarcity made flesh.

Before any theory, before any market, there is the gnawing void that demands filling. Hunger is economics incarnate: unlimited wants meeting limited resources in the most visceral way possible.

A hungry person will:
- Trade anything for food
- Work any job for a meal  
- Save food for later (first investment!)
- Share food to build alliances (social capital!)
- Fight others for food (competition!)

Every economic behavior has roots in this primal emptiness. The stock market trader optimizing portfolios is, at infinite regress, just a sophisticated hungry ape ensuring tomorrow's meal.

Hunger teaches:
- Resources matter because bodies need them
- Time matters because hunger returns
- Cooperation matters because hunting together works
- Innovation matters because better food-getting means survival

The genius of human economy? We transformed hunger from emergency to motivation, from crisis to engine of civilization.
