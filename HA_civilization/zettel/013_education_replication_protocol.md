# Education Replication Protocol

Education = Cultural DNA replication.

Transmits:
- Knowledge (accumulated facts)
- Skills (accumulated techniques)
- Values (accumulated preferences)
- Methods (how to learn more)

Each generation doesn't start from zero.
Civilization's longevity depends on transmission fidelity.
