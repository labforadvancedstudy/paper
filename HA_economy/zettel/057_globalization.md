# Globalization

## Core Insight
The world becoming one market: distance dies, borders blur, cultures merge - economics at planetary scale.

Globalization is economics overcoming geography. What started with silk roads accelerated with container ships and exploded with internet. The village market became global marketplace.

Globalization dimensions:
- **Trade** - goods flow everywhere
- **Finance** - capital knows no borders
- **Production** - supply chains span continents
- **Information** - instant global communication
- **Culture** - ideas, styles, values spread
- **Labor** - people follow opportunity

Effects cascade:
- Efficiency gains (produce where cheapest)
- Choice explosion (access to world's goods)
- Competition intensifies (compete with planet)
- Wages converge (slowly, painfully)
- Cultures homogenize (McDonaldization)
- Risks correlate (2008 went global instantly)

The backlash builds: jobs flee to cheaper places, communities hollow out, inequality soars, identity threatens. Populism rises against cosmopolitanism.

Globalization seems inevitable yet faces resistance. Technology pushes integration while politics pulls apart. The tension defines our era.
