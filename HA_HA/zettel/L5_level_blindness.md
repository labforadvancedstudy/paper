# Level Blindness

## Core Insight
The cognitive trap where we can't see levels above or below our current understanding - like fish unaware of water or philosophers unaware they're made of cells.

Level blindness is universal. Physicists often can't see why consciousness matters ("it's just atoms!"). Philosophers often can't see why atoms matter ("consciousness is fundamental!"). Each level creates its own reality tunnel.

The blindness works both ways. From L3, L1 seems trivially simple and L7 seems mystically complex. But from L7, L3 is the one that looks naive. We're all experts at our level and beginners at others.

This explains so much miscommunication. When an L6 thinker talks to an L3 thinker, they're literally inhabiting different realities. The L6's abstractions sound like nonsense; the L3's details sound like trivia. Both are right at their level.

Breaking level blindness requires deliberate effort. You must consciously climb up or down, temporarily abandoning your comfortable level. It's cognitively expensive, which is why most people stay at their preferred abstraction level for life.
