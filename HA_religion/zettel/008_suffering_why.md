# Suffering Why

## Core Insight
The wound that births theology - pain that demands explanation transforms into humanity's deepest question.

A child with scraped knee cries. Parent kisses it better. Universe makes sense. But then: leukemia at age four. Tsunami swallowing villages. Holocaust. Universe breaks. The cry changes from "ouch" to "why?"

Suffering differs from pain:
- Pain: nervous system firing
- Suffering: meaning system breaking
- Pain: body's alarm
- Suffering: soul's confusion

The "why" of suffering creates religion because silence is unbearable. Every tradition offers answers:
- **Karma**: Past actions, present consequences
- **Test**: God strengthening faith
- **Illusion**: Suffering isn't ultimately real
- **Freedom's price**: Real choice enables evil
- **Mystery**: Beyond human understanding

But watch a parent by a child's hospital bed. Explanations evaporate. The why remains, sharper than ever. This is religion's ground zero - where easy answers die and faith either breaks or transforms into something that includes tragedy without explaining it away.

Suffering is the question mark God refuses to straighten into an exclamation point.
