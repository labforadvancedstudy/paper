# Electrical Systems

## Core Insight
Electrical systems are controlled electron economics - creating markets where charge flows according to rules we design, building invisible cities of current and voltage.

Electricity is pure potential seeking ground. Electrical systems give it productive paths. We create electron highways (conductors), toll booths (resistors), parking lots (capacitors), traffic circles (inductors). The system orchestrates flow into function.

The magic is instantaneous action at a distance. Flip a switch here, light appears there - faster than thought. Electrical systems collapse space, making everywhere adjacent to everywhere else through copper connection.

From power grids to microchips: same principles, different scales. Voltage drives, current flows, resistance controls, power dissipates. The equations scale from milliwatts to megawatts. Electrical systems prove that invisible forces, properly channeled, reshape reality.
