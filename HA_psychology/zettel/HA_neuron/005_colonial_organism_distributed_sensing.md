## The Emergence of Collective Awareness

In colonial organisms like sponges and hydra,
we see the first experiments in distributed consciousness -
many cells acting as one sensory system.

### No Brain, Yet Behavior
- Sponges contract when touched
- Hydra coordinates tentacle movement
- Colonies respond as unified wholes
- Intelligence without centralization

### The Distribution Problem
How do you coordinate without a coordinator?
- Chemical gradients provide global state
- Local cell-to-cell signaling
- Emergent patterns from simple rules
- The first implementation of swarm intelligence

### Sensing as a Collective Act
Each cell contributes:
- Local environmental data
- Propagation of neighbor's signals  
- Integration through summation
- The colony "knows" more than any cell
