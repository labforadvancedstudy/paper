# Transcription

## Core Insight
Life's photocopier - where permanent DNA instructions become temporary RNA messages, because originals are too precious to use directly.

DNA is like a master blueprint locked in a vault (the nucleus). You don't drag blueprints to construction sites - you make copies. That's transcription: copying DNA's message into RNA that can leave the nucleus.

The enzyme RNA polymerase is the copy machine. It unzips DNA, reads one strand, and builds complementary RNA. Speed: 40 nucleotides per second. Accuracy: 1 error per 10,000 bases. Good enough for temporary messages.

But here's the clever part: not all DNA gets transcribed. Cells read only the chapters they need. A liver cell transcribes liver genes, ignoring brain genes. Same library, different books checked out. This selective reading makes different cell types possible.

The process is regulated by promoters (start signals), enhancers (volume controls), and terminators (stop signs). It's not just copying - it's selective, controlled, responsive copying. Information when and where needed.
