# Metamodernity

## Core Insight
Society oscillating between sincerity and irony, construction and deconstruction - holding contradictions without resolving them.

After modernity's grand narratives (progress!) and postmodernity's skepticism (nothing is true!), metamodernity says: both, neither, something new. We know social reality is constructed but live as if it's real. We see through institutions while needing them. We're ironic believers.

Metamodern society performs authenticity while knowing it's performance. Creates meaning while acknowledging meaninglessness. Builds communities while staying fluid. It's not synthesis but oscillation - moving between poles without rest.

This might be society becoming conscious of itself as process. Not arriving at truth but dancing with uncertainty. Not solving paradoxes but surfing them. A society that knows it's making itself up and does it anyway, seriously and playfully at once.
