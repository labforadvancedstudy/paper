# Fire Mastery

## Core Insight
Controlling fire was humanity's first victory over the sun - stealing the gods' technology and making it servant.

Every other animal runs from fire. We run toward it. We feed it, carry it, worship it. Fire transformed us from just another ape to something new: the cooking ape.

Cooking isn't just about taste. It's external digestion. Fire breaks down food so our guts don't have to work as hard. That saved energy went straight to our brains. We literally cooked ourselves smart.

But deeper: fire extends the day. Darkness no longer means stop. Around fire, we could work, talk, think, dream beyond sunset. Fire gave us time. And in that extra time, civilization was born.
