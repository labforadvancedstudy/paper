# Tides

## Core Insight
The ocean's rhythmic breathing is the Moon's gravity made visible - Earth's liquid envelope responding to celestial mechanics with clockwork precision.

Twice daily, the sea rises and falls, advances and retreats. This isn't Earth breathing but the Moon pulling. The Moon's gravity tugs Earth's near side stronger than its far side, creating two bulges - one toward the Moon, one away. Earth rotates through these bulges, creating high tides. Between bulges, low tides. Simple in principle, complex in practice.

The Sun adds its own pull, creating spring tides when aligned with the Moon, neap tides when perpendicular. Local geography amplifies or dampens - the Bay of Fundy sees 50-foot tides, the Mediterranean barely notices. Tides power ecosystems, erode coastlines, generate energy, and slowly steal Earth's rotation, lengthening our days. In tides, we see gravity's gentle but relentless sculpting of worlds.
