# Planetary Migration

## Core Insight
Planets don't stay where they're born - gravitational interactions and disk dynamics cause worlds to spiral inward or drift outward, rewriting the Solar System's architecture over millions of years.

The nice neat Solar System we see today wasn't always so orderly. Jupiter probably formed farther out and migrated inward, then back out again (the "Grand Tack"). This migration scattered the asteroid belt, delivered water to Earth, and may have prevented a super-Earth from forming. Neptune and Uranus likely switched places. The entire outer Solar System rearranged itself like furniture in a cosmic living room.

Migration explains mysteries: why Mars is so small (Jupiter starved it), why the asteroid belt exists (migration prevented coalescence), why Earth has water (delivered from beyond the frost line). The Solar System is dynamic, not static. Planets wander. The configuration we see is just one frame in an ongoing movie of orbital evolution. Our cosmic neighborhood has been thoroughly remodeled.
