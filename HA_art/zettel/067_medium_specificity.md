# Medium Specificity

## Core Insight
Truth to materials - the modernist faith that each medium has essential qualities to be revealed, not hidden, creating purity through limitation.

Greenberg's doctrine:
- Painting is flatness
- Sculpture is space
- Photography is light
- Each medium pure
- Mixing corrupts

Medium-specific qualities:
- Paint: viscosity, color, texture
- Stone: weight, grain, permanence
- Video: time, light, movement
- Code: logic, iteration, interaction
- Sound: frequency, duration, space

Arguments for:
- Honesty in making
- Deep exploration
- Skill development
- Clear evaluation
- Historical continuity

Arguments against:
- Arbitrary boundaries
- Innovation stifled
- Hybridity natural
- Digital dissolves categories
- Life isn't pure

Historical progression:
- Academic separation
- Modernist purification
- Minimalist reduction
- Postmodern mixing
- Contemporary whatever

Contemporary relevance questioned:
- Everything digitized
- Media converge
- Disciplines blur
- Materials expand
- Categories explode

Yet something persists:
- Oil paint differs from pixels
- Bronze differs from plastic
- Each tool shapes thought
- Materials speak
- Specificity teaches

New medium specificities:
- Instagram's square
- TikTok's duration
- VR's immersion
- AI's statistics
- Blockchain's verification
