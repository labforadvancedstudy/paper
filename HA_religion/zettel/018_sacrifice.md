# Sacrifice

## Core Insight
Sacrifice is making sacred through giving up - transforming loss into connection with the divine.

To sacrifice is literally to "make sacred." Across cultures, humans give up what's valuable to connect with what's ultimate. From ancient altars to modern fasting, the pattern persists: renunciation creates relation.

Sacrifice logic:
- Give to receive
- Lose to find
- Die to live
- Empty to fill
- Release to connect

Historical sacrifice evolution:
- Animal sacrifice: Life for life
- Grain offerings: First fruits given
- Monetary donation: Value transferred
- Time sacrifice: Attention offered
- Ego sacrifice: Self surrendered

Modern sacrifices often hidden:
- Parents for children
- Soldiers for nation
- Activists for cause
- Artists for beauty
- Scientists for truth

The sacrifice paradox: What we grip, we lose. What we release, we receive. Not transaction but transformation. Not payment but participation. The universe operates on generosity, and sacrifice aligns us with that flow.

True sacrifice isn't losing something outside to gain something else. It's discovering that in giving, we become more ourselves. The altar transforms both offering and offerer.

Sacrifice remains because the need remains: to break ego's grip through generous giving.
