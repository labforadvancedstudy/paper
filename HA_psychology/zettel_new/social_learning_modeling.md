# Social Learning: Modeling

**Core Concept**: We learn by watching others, without direct experience or reinforcement.

## One-Line Definition
Observation of others' behaviors and consequences becomes our own learning.

## Simple Mental Model
Like downloading someone else's experience as your own software update - their trial and error becomes your knowledge.

## Key Mechanism
1. Attention to model's behavior
2. Retention in memory
3. Motor reproduction capability
4. Motivation to perform

## Practical Example
A child watches their older sibling get burned touching a hot stove and screaming. The younger child never touches hot stoves - they learned from observation, not experience.

## Common Misconception
We only imitate behaviors we see rewarded. Actually, we learn equally from others' punishments - sometimes more effectively.
