# Mechanical Advantage

## Core Insight
Mechanical advantage is nature's trade agreement - offering force for distance at a fixed exchange rate, revealing that the universe runs on conservation, not charity.

You cannot cheat physics, but you can negotiate. Mechanical advantage is the negotiation: want to lift 1000 pounds with 100 pounds of force? Sure, but you'll move it 1 inch for every 10 inches you pull. The universe always balances its books.

This principle underlies all machines. Levers trade arm length for force. Gears trade rotation speed for torque. Pulleys trade rope length for load. Screws trade rotation for linear force. Always the same bargain: distance for force.

The profound lesson: there's no free lunch in physics, but there are payment plans. Mechanical advantage doesn't create energy; it reshapes it to fit our needs. It's engineering's first principle: work with nature's rules, not against them.
