# Form

## Core Insight
When shape gains dimension and volume, it becomes form - the difference between a circle and a sphere, between drawing and sculpture, between map and territory.

Form is shape plus:
- Depth (third dimension)
- Volume (space occupied)
- Mass (visual weight)
- Surface (how light behaves)
- Presence (objects not images)

A circle is idea; sphere is thing. This leap from 2D to 3D mirrors consciousness evolution - from seeing surfaces to understanding objects. Babies learn this: the drawing of ball isn't ball. Can't throw picture.

Form creates through:
- Light and shadow (2D illusion of 3D)
- Overlapping (depth through occlusion)
- Perspective (size indicates distance)
- Modeling (gradual tonal changes)
- Actual dimension (sculpture, architecture)

Artists obsess over form because it bridges idea and reality. Renaissance masters spent years drawing spheres, cones, cylinders - not as exercises but as universe-understanding. All complex forms decompose to simple volumes. Head = sphere + cylinder. Tree = cylinder + sphere.

Digital art struggles with form. Screens are flat pretending depth. 3D printing reverses this - code becoming thing. VR attempts full form immersion. But hand knows difference between virtual and actual form.

Form psychology runs deep. We navigate by reading forms. Judge distance, size, threat. Form errors disturb - uncanny valley, impossible objects. Escher played here, creating forms that cannot exist but do on paper.
