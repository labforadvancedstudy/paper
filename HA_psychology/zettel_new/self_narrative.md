# Self Narrative

## Core Insight
You're not a person - you're a story you tell yourself about a person.

The brain is a meaning-making machine that can't tolerate randomness. So it weaves every experience, choice, and memory into a coherent narrative: "This is who I am." But the story changes with each telling. Depressed people tell tragedy; narcissists tell epics. The plot determines what you notice, remember, and do next. Change the story, change the person. That's why therapy works - it's collaborative fiction editing.
