# Public Goods

## Core Insight
The sharing paradox: goods that everyone can use without using up - where exclusion fails and markets break.

Public goods defy economic gravity. They're non-excludable (can't keep people out) and non-rivalrous (my use doesn't diminish yours). Think lighthouses, national defense, mathematical theorems.

Public goods characteristics:
- **Free rider problem** - why pay if you get it anyway?
- **Underproduction** - markets won't provide enough
- **No price discovery** - can't find "right" price
- **Collective benefit** - everyone gains
- **Provision challenges** - who pays, how much?

Examples span from obvious to subtle:
- Clean air (until it's scarce)
- Basic research (knowledge spreads)
- Herd immunity (vaccination effects)
- Open source software (infinitely copyable)
- Social trust (benefits all)

The profound challenge: public goods are where individual rationality creates collective irrationality. Everyone wants them, no one wants to pay, so they go unprovided.

Solutions are imperfect: government provision (inefficiency), voluntary contribution (insufficient), bundling with private goods (limited), social pressure (unreliable).
