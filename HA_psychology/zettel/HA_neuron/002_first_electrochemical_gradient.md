# 002_first_electrochemical_gradient

## The Original Computational Medium

Before neurons, before brains, before thought - there was the gradient.
A simple chemical imbalance across a membrane, yet it contains the seed
of all future computation.

### The Fundamental Asymmetry
- Inside vs outside
- High concentration vs low concentration  
- Potential energy waiting to be released
- The first "bit" of biological information

### From Chemistry to Computation
When ions flow down their gradient, they carry more than charge -
they carry information. The cell has learned to read and write
in the language of electrochemistry.

### The Proto-Decision
Open the channel or keep it closed?
The first binary choice that would eventually
become the foundation of neural decision-making.
