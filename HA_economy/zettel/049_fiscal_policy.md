# Fiscal Policy

## Core Insight
Fiscal policy is government as economic player - using spending and taxation to steer the economy through troubled waters.

While monetary policy works through money supply, fiscal policy works through government's wallet. Recession? Spend more, tax less - inject demand. Inflation? Spend less, tax more - cool things down. It's Keynesianism in action: government as counterweight to private sector mood swings.

But fiscal policy is where economics meets politics head-on. Every spending decision has constituents. Every tax has opponents. What starts as economic theory becomes political battleground. Should we build bridges or cut taxes? Fund research or reduce debt? The answers depend on who you ask.

There's also the timing problem. By the time Congress recognizes recession, debates solutions, passes bills, and implements programs, the recession might be over. Fiscal policy is steering a supertanker with a rubber band - massive power but terrible precision.

The deeper issue is sustainability. Governments can run deficits (spend more than they tax) because they can borrow. But debt accumulates. Future taxpayers inherit today's spending decisions. How much debt is too much? Japan functions with 260% debt-to-GDP. Greece collapsed at 180%. The limits are psychological as much as mathematical.

Fiscal policy reveals government as both referee and player in the economic game.
