# Stakeholder Reality

## Core Insight
Companies exist at the intersection of multiple interests - shareholders, employees, customers, communities, environment - each with valid claims on corporate behavior and outcomes.

The shareholder primacy doctrine ("maximize shareholder value") proved too narrow. It optimizes one variable while destroying others. Employees burnout, communities suffer, environment degrades. Eventually, even shareholders lose as unsustainability surfaces.

Stakeholder capitalism recognizes reality: companies depend on all stakeholders. Alienate employees, talent flees. Ignore customers, revenue vanishes. Damage communities, social license revokes. Harm environment, future disappears. All stakes matter.

But balancing stakeholders is complex calculus. Interests conflict. Time horizons vary. Power imbalances persist. The challenge isn't recognizing stakeholders but navigating their competing claims while maintaining coherent direction. It's jazz, not symphony.
