# Technology Acceleration

## Core Insight
Technology isn't just tools - it's evolution breaking free from biology and running at the speed of thought.

Biological evolution: millions of years for better eyes. Technological evolution: decades from first flight to moon landing. Technology is evolution unleashed from DNA's slow copying, running on the faster substrate of human minds and machines.

Each technology enables the next. Bronze tools make iron possible. Steam engines enable precision manufacturing. Computers design better computers. It's not linear growth - it's exponential explosion.

We're approaching the singularity: the point where technological change happens faster than human comprehension. Civilization is building its own replacement, and we're cheering it on because we can't stop. The tool-makers are being remade by their tools.
