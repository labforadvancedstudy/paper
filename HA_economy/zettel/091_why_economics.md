# Why Economics?

## Core Insight
The deepest question: why does the universe create systems for allocating resources? Economics as cosmic phenomenon.

Why does economics exist at all? Not just human economics - but the general phenomenon of resource allocation, from cellular metabolism to galactic formation. Why does the universe create scarcity and systems to manage it?

Possible answers:
- **Thermodynamic necessity** - entropy requires energy gradients
- **Evolutionary inevitability** - competition for resources drives complexity
- **Information processing** - economics is how universe computes
- **Consciousness requirement** - awareness needs limitation
- **Game theoretical** - interesting universes have constraints

The pattern appears everywhere:
- Cells economize ATP
- Plants compete for sunlight
- Animals defend territory
- Humans create markets
- Stars trade mass for light
- Galaxies exchange matter

Perhaps economics is how the universe experiences itself - through wanting, striving, choosing. Without scarcity, no decisions. Without decisions, no consciousness. Without consciousness, no universe worth having?

The ultimate question: is economics a bug (suffering from want) or feature (meaning through choice)?
