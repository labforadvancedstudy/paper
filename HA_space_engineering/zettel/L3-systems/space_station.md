# Space Station

## Core Insight
A city in the sky where humans live and work - the most complex machines ever assembled, maintaining Earth-like conditions in the most Earth-unlike place, proving we can build homes beyond the world.

A space station is spacecraft scaled to architecture. Not visiting space but living there. Every problem of spacecraft multiplied by duration, crew size, and the messy reality of human habitation. It's a closed ecological system leaking slowly into vacuum.

The engineering cascade:
- Pressurized volume (living space costs millions per cubic meter)
- Life support (recycling everything possible)
- Power generation (continuous demand)
- Thermal management (humans are 100W heaters)
- Attitude control (massive yet must point precisely)
- Microgravity (everything floats, including dust)
- Logistics (every toothbrush launched)

ISS as existence proof:
- 420 tons assembled over decades
- Football field of solar panels
- Six person crew typical
- 90 minute orbits (16 sunrises daily)
- Requires constant resupply
- International cooperation mandatory

The daily reality:
- Exercise 2+ hours (bone/muscle loss)
- Maintenance never ends
- Science squeezed between survival tasks
- Privacy nearly impossible
- Bathroom procedures complex
- Sleep disturbed by fans, pumps, sunrise

Station types reveal purposes:
- Government: Science and prestige (ISS, Mir)
- Commercial: Manufacturing or tourism (future)
- Military: Reconnaissance (MOL, cancelled)
- Gateway: Staging for deep space
- Rotating: Artificial gravity (still dreams)

The recycling imperative:
- Water: 93% recovery from urine, humidity
- Oxygen: From water electrolysis
- CO2: Scrubbed, dumped (not yet recycled)
- Waste: Minimal recycling (burned on reentry)
- Complete closure remains impossible

Challenges compound:
- Micrometeorite shields add mass
- Every joint potential leak
- Resupply dependency vulnerability  
- Fire/depressurization nightmares
- Psychological stress accumulates
- Political stability required

Yet stations prove: humans can live in space. Not visit, not survive - live. Work. Create. Form communities in vacuum. They're civilization's first permanent foothold beyond Earth.
