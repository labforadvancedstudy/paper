# Generational Shift

## Core Insight
The eternal return with a difference - where each generation rejects and recreates the previous, creating spiraling progress through rebellion that eventually becomes tradition.

Generational patterns repeat:
- Young reject established
- Radical becomes academic
- Outsiders become insiders
- Revolution becomes institution
- Children rebel again

Current shifts visible:
- Millennials question ownership
- Gen Z assumes digital
- Identity politics central
- Climate anxiety pervasive
- Traditional skills revival

Technology marks generations:
- Boomers: TV natives
- Gen X: Computer adapters
- Millennials: Internet natives
- Gen Z: Mobile natives
- Alpha: AI natives

Art world generations clash:
- Materials vs. concepts
- Objects vs. experiences
- Galleries vs. Instagram
- Collecting vs. accessing
- Making vs. networking

Each generation's "new":
- Abstract Expressionism's emotion
- Pop's commercial embrace
- Minimalism's reduction
- Conceptualism's dematerialization
- Today's re-materialization

Intergenerational dynamics:
- Mentorship vs. competition
- Inheritance vs. rejection
- Wisdom vs. relevance
- Experience vs. energy
- Tradition vs. innovation

Market responds differently:
- Young artist speculation
- Mid-career neglect
- Late career canonization
- Posthumous appreciation
- Cyclical rediscovery

Key insight: Each generation thinks it invented sex, rebellion, and authenticity. Each generation eventually becomes what it rebelled against. Art history is generational trauma/inspiration cycling endlessly.
