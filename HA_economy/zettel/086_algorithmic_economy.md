# Algorithmic Economy

## Core Insight
The economy is increasingly run by algorithms making decisions at superhuman speed - markets are becoming conversations between machines, with humans as increasingly puzzled bystanders.

High-frequency trading started it. Algorithms now execute 70% of stock trades, making decisions in microseconds based on patterns humans can't see. They trade on news before humans finish reading headlines. They detect other algorithms and engage in digital warfare - spoofing, stuffing, momentum ignition.

But it goes beyond finance. Uber's algorithm sets prices and assigns drivers. Amazon's algorithm decides prices, inventory, and what you see. Google's algorithm shapes what billions learn. Dating apps algorithmically determine who might find love. Algorithms increasingly decide who gets loans, jobs, parole.

We're building an economy where human judgment is too slow. By the time you understand why the algorithm made a decision, it's made a million more. The feedback loops between algorithms create dynamics no one designed or understands. Flash crashes happen in minutes. Algorithmic bias perpetuates discrimination at scale.

The deeper issue: algorithms optimize what's measurable, not what matters. Click-through rates, not truth. Engagement, not wellbeing. Profit, not purpose. We're turning the economy into a paperclip maximizer.

Yet we can't go back. Algorithms coordinate complexity beyond human ability. The question isn't whether to use them but how to ensure they serve human flourishing rather than consuming it.
