# Limits of Reductionism

## Core Insight
Chemistry can't be fully reduced to physics - new principles emerge at the molecular level that aren't predictable from quantum mechanics alone.

In principle, chemistry is applied quantum mechanics. In practice, it's not. We can't derive chemistry from first principles for anything beyond hydrogen. Even if we could solve the equations, would we understand? A wavefunction for a protein would be incomprehensible.

Chemistry has its own logic. Functional groups behave consistently across molecules. Reaction mechanisms follow patterns. These regularities aren't deducible from Schrödinger's equation - they're discovered empirically, then rationalized post-hoc.

Consider chirality. Left and right hands are equally stable quantum mechanically, yet life chose left-handed amino acids, right-handed sugars. This broken symmetry cascades through biochemistry. Chemistry develops historical contingency that physics can't predict.
