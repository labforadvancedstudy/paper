# DevOps
- **Level**: L5
- **Definition**: The marriage of development and operations
- **Korean**: Îç∞Î∏åÏòµÏä§
- **Context**: When developers are forced to feel the pain they cause

## Core Understanding
DevOps is what happens when you make developers responsible for their code at 3 AM. It's the radical idea that the people who break production should also fix it. Like making arsonists join the fire department, it creates a beautiful feedback loop of suffering and enlightenment.

## Deeper Insights
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration, Continuous Disappointment
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Because nothing says "reliable" like executable documentation
- **Monitoring**: Watching systems fail in real-time with pretty graphs
- **On-Call Rotation**: Distributed suffering for distributed systems

# Post-deployment regret

## Connection to Truth
DevOps embodies the Buddhist principle that suffering leads to enlightenment. By making developers experience the consequences of their actions, we create a karmic loop of cause and effect. It's applied philosophy: you shall reap what you deploy.

## When It Matters
- **Deployment Velocity**: Ship bugs faster than ever
- **System Reliability**: Someone's always watching (and crying)
- **Automation**: Because humans make mistakes, let's automate them
- **Culture Change**: From "not my problem" to "everything is my problem"

## Human Element
DevOps engineers are the Swiss Army knives of tech‚Äîequally bad at development and operations, but somehow responsible for both. They speak in pipelines and think in containers. They've automated themselves into permanent on-call duty and convinced themselves this is progress. They're the digital janitors with admin access.
