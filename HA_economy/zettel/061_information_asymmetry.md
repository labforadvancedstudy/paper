# Information Asymmetry

## Core Insight
When knowledge is power and power is profit: the market distortions from unequal information - economics in the dark.

Information asymmetry occurs when one party knows more than another in a transaction. The seller knows the car is a lemon; the buyer doesn't. This knowledge gap breaks the assumption of perfect markets.

Asymmetry types:
- **Hidden information** - one side knows more
- **Hidden action** - can't observe behavior
- **Adverse selection** - bad products drive out good
- **Moral hazard** - insurance changes behavior
- **Principal-agent** - your interests ≠ my interests

Classic problems:
- Used car markets collapse (only lemons sell)
- Insurance attracts the sick
- CEOs maximize personal gain
- Banks take excess risks
- Quality producers can't prove it

Solutions attempted:
- Signaling (education as credential)
- Screening (tests and trials)
- Reputation systems (eBay ratings)
- Regulation (disclosure requirements)
- Alignment (stock options)

The deep insight: information is the hidden infrastructure of markets. When information flows break, markets break. The internet promised information democracy but created new asymmetries.
