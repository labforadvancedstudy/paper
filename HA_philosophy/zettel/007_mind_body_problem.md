# Mind-Body Problem

## Core Insight
How does meat think? The hard problem that spawned all philosophy of mind.

## The Impossible Connection

Descartes split them: res cogitans (thinking stuff) and res extensa (extended stuff). Then spent years trying to glue them back together. The pineal gland didn't work.

L1: What problem? I think with my head
L2: Soul inhabits body like driver in car
L3: Mind and body are distinct substances
L4: Mind emerges from brain complexity
L5: Mind is what brain does
L6: "Mind" and "body" are category errors
L7: Both are constructs of power/discourse
L8: Information patterns in different substrates
L9: The question assumes false distinctions

Every solution creates new problems. If mind is brain activity, why does it feel like something? If they're separate, how do they interact?
