# Unemployment

## Core Insight
Willing hands with nothing to do: when human potential meets no outlet - the economy's cruelest inefficiency.

Unemployment is want meeting void. People eager to work, to contribute, to earn - but no match exists. It's economics' most visible failure, most human waste.

Unemployment types:
- **Frictional** - between jobs, searching
- **Structural** - skills don't match needs
- **Cyclical** - recession-caused joblessness
- **Technological** - replaced by machines
- **Voluntary** - choosing not to work

Unemployment costs:
- Individual (income loss, skill decay, despair)
- Family (stress, poverty, instability)
- Social (crime, unrest, lost output)
- Economic (wasted human capital)
- Psychological (identity crisis, depression)

The paradox: some unemployment is "natural" - people switching jobs, retraining. Zero unemployment might mean trapped workers, no dynamism.

Yet mass unemployment is tragedy. Millions wanting to contribute but system saying "not needed." It reveals economics isn't just about efficiency but human dignity. A job is more than income - it's purpose, identity, belonging.
