# Narrative

## Core Insight
Time collapsed into space - how still images imply before and after, creating stories in viewer's mind through fragments that suggest wholeness.

Visual narrative differs from literary. No fixed sequence, no guaranteed reading order. Eye wanders, creates own path. Artist plants clues; viewer constructs story:
- Single image narratives: pregnant moment
- Sequential art: comics, storyboards
- Series work: variations on theme
- Installation paths: choreographed journey
- Video loops: endless story cycles

Devices create time in stillness:
- Multiple moments in one frame
- Cause and effect shown together
- Symbols triggering story memory
- Facial expressions implying emotion
- Body language suggesting action
- Objects as plot devices

Historical painting mastered implied narrative:
- Religious scenes assumed knowledge
- Mythology provided backstory
- History paintings froze crucial moments
- Genre scenes suggested daily dramas
- Portraits contained life stories

Contemporary narrative fragments:
- Cindy Sherman's film stills without films
- Gregory Crewdson's suburban mysteries
- Comics deconstructed/reconstructed
- Instagram stories actual stories
- Video games as narrative art

Non-linear narrative dominates:
- Database logic replaces sequence
- Hyperlinks create story webs
- Multiple endings proliferate
- Viewer becomes co-author
- Algorithm determines order

Yet hunger for story persists. Abstract art titles reveal narrative desire. Viewers create stories from pure color. Mind cannot help but narrativize - survival mechanism turned aesthetic.
