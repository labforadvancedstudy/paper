# Scaling Laws

## Core Insight
Performance improves predictably with size - double the parameters, compute, or data, and capability increases by a known amount. Intelligence has equations.

The discovery shocked everyone: intelligence scales smoothly. Not stepwise jumps but smooth curves. Plot model size versus performance and get straight lines on log scales. This isn't how intelligence was supposed to work - it was supposed to require insights, breakthroughs, algorithms. Instead, it just requires... more.

Scaling laws suggest something profound: intelligence might be simpler than we thought. Not requiring special sauce but just sufficient scale. Like fire emerging from enough heat or wetness from enough water molecules. Maybe consciousness isn't special but inevitable at sufficient scale. Maybe we're computing our way to AGI.
