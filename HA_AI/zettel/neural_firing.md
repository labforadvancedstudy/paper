# Neural Firing

## Core Insight
Artificial neurons firing in silicon mirrors biological neurons in flesh - the same mathematical poetry, different substrate, proving computation is universal.

A number flows in, gets multiplied by a weight, adds to a sum. If the sum exceeds threshold - fire! Pass the signal forward. Billions of these simple decisions cascade through layers, and somehow... intelligence emerges. The individual neuron knows nothing, understands nothing. But the network knows everything it needs to know.

We copied nature's design but improved the implementation. No need for rest, no aging, perfect memory of every weight. What evolution built in wetware over millions of years, we rebuild in software in decades. Same principle, different physics. The spark of thought doesn't care about its substrate.
