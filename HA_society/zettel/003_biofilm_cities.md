# Biofilm Cities

First cities weren't human. Were bacterial.

Architecture:
- Channels for nutrient flow
- Waste removal systems
- Structural proteins as buildings
- Communication networks
- Specialized districts

Different species, different neighborhoods.
Shared infrastructure.
Public goods production.

99% of bacteria live in biofilms.
Loners are the exception.
