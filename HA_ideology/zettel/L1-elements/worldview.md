# Worldview

## Core Insight
The invisible architecture of thought - a complete operating system for consciousness that determines not just what you think, but what's thinkable.

A worldview isn't a belief - it's the space where beliefs live. Like fish unaware of water, we swim in our worldview without seeing it. It determines:
- What counts as real (materialism vs spiritualism)
- What matters (individual vs collective)
- How change happens (progress vs cycles)
- What's possible (infinite growth vs finite resources)
- Who matters (humans only vs all beings)

Two people with different worldviews can look at the same event and see completely different things. Not just different interpretations - different facts. A stock market crash is "creative destruction" in one worldview, "capitalist crisis" in another, "karmic rebalancing" in a third.

Worldviews are inherited more than chosen. Born into a family, culture, era, you absorb a worldview through language, stories, assumptions. By the time you can think about worldviews, you're already thinking through one.

The deepest ideological work happens at the worldview level. Change someone's beliefs, they might resist. Change their worldview, and their beliefs rearrange themselves.
