# Retrograde Motion

## Core Insight
Planets sometimes reverse course in the sky - an optical illusion that stumped astronomers for millennia, proving that perspective matters as much as position.

Watch Mars for months. It travels east against the stars, then slows, stops, reverses west, stops again, resumes eastward. This loop-de-loop baffled ancient astronomers who invented complex epicycles to explain it. The truth is simpler and more profound: we're moving too. When Earth overtakes Mars in our inside track around the Sun, Mars appears to move backward, like a car we pass on a highway.

Retrograde motion is the universe's perspective lesson. What we see depends on where we are and how we're moving. The planets never actually reverse - the reversal exists only from our moving viewpoint. This illusion, once solved, proved Earth orbits the Sun. Sometimes the most confusing observations hide the simplest truths.
