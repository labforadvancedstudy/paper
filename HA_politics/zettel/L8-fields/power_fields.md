# Power Fields

## Core Insight
Power as field phenomenon - not possessed by individuals but flowing through social space like magnetism through matter, creating zones of force that shape all movement within them.

Abandon the billiard ball model (A has power, uses it on B). Instead: power is the field itself, the invisible lines of force that make some movements easy, others impossible, some thoughts thinkable, others unimaginable.

Like gravity, power fields:\n- Bend space (social space)
- Create attractors (centers of power)
- Generate orbits (dependency relations)
- Warp time (different zones, different speeds)
- Have event horizons (points of no return)

You feel power fields bodily:
- Entering a courtroom, a palace, a police station
- The way bodies arrange themselves around authority
- How speech patterns change near power
- The exhaustion of resisting the field
- The ease of flowing with it

Power fields layer and interfere:
- Economic fields (money flows)
- Cultural fields (prestige gradients)
- Political fields (authority zones)
- Information fields (knowledge differentials)
- Violent fields (force potentials)

These fields aren't metaphorical. They're as real as electromagnetic fields - patterns in the social medium that exert genuine force. Bodies move differently in different fields. Thoughts think differently. Possibilities open and close.

The political question becomes: how do we map these fields? How do we generate counter-fields? How do we recognize we're always already in the field?
