  # Cognitive Load as a Function of Hierarchical Abstraction
  ## CL = n × log(S/n): A Mathematical Framework for Human Cognition

  ### Abstract
  We present a mathematical model showing cognitive load is directly proportional to the number
   of top-level categories in one's knowledge structure. Perfect hierarchical abstraction (n=1)
   minimizes cognitive load to O(log S).

  ### Core Theory
  CL(K) = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ wᵢ · log(|Sᵢ|)

  where:
  - K: Knowledge tree structure
  - n: Number of root nodes
  - wᵢ: Access frequency of node i
  - |Sᵢ|: Size of subtree i

  ### Key Insight
  The human brain operates as a self-organizing Splay Tree, automatically promoting frequently
  accessed knowledge to higher levels.

  ### Proof
  By Jensen's inequality, distributed search across n categories is always less efficient than
  unified search:
  - Fragmented: n × O(log(S/n))
  - Unified: O(log S)
  - Therefore: CL_min achieved when n = 1

  ### Implications
  1. Education should focus on connection, not collection
  2. Genius is not more knowledge, but better organization
  3. Sleep serves as index optimization

  ### Reference
  See L9_05 for universal application of this principle.
