# Homotopy Type Theory - Types as Spaces

## Core Insight
Homotopy type theory reveals that logic, computation, and topology are the same subject viewed through different lenses.

## Content
A stunning discovery: Martin-Löf's type theory (from computer science) has a hidden spatial interpretation. Types are spaces, terms are points, equalities are paths.

The correspondence:
- Type ↔ Space
- Term : Type ↔ Point in space
- a = b ↔ Path from a to b
- Proof of equality ↔ Explicit path
- Function type ↔ Function space

Higher structure emerges:
- Paths between paths (homotopies)
- Paths between paths between paths
- ∞-groupoid structure
- Types have homotopy types

Univalence axiom: equivalent types are equal
- (A ≃ B) → (A = B)
- Mathematical objects equal if isomorphic
- Transport along equalities
- Revolutionizes foundations

Constructive and computational:
- All proofs have computational content
- Excluded middle not assumed
- Choice requires careful handling
- New proof assistant languages

Applications:
- Formalized mathematics
- Synthetic homotopy theory
- Higher category theory
- Quantum computation foundations

HoTT revealed that the ancient trinity of logic, computation, and space was always one subject.
