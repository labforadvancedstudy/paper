# Consciousness

## Core Insight
The awareness that is aware of being aware - the recursive loop that creates the self.

## L1 → L7 Journey

At L1, consciousness is just "I hurt, I hungry, I want."
At L3, it asks "What am I?"
At L5, it realizes "I think, therefore I am."
At L7, it discovers "There is no I, only processes."

Consciousness is the universe's way of looking at itself, creating the strange loop where observer and observed are one. Every philosophy begins here: the shock of realizing you exist.
