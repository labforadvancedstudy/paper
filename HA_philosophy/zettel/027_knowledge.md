# Knowledge

## Core Insight
Justified true belief - except when it isn't.

## The Gettier Problem

For 2000 years: knowledge = justified true belief. Then Gettier: you believe your cow is in the field. It is (hidden). You see a cow-shaped rock. Justified? Yes. True? Yes. Knowledge? No.

L1: Know by doing
L2: Divine revelation
L3: Rational certainty
L4: Empirical testing
L5: Coherent systems
L6: Pragmatic success
L7: Power's construct
L8: Predictive models
L9: Knowledge dissolves

The crisis: every attempt to define knowledge assumes knowledge of knowledge.
