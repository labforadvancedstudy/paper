# Exhibition Making

## Core Insight
Temporary architecture of meaning - where individual works combine into larger arguments, space becomes narrative, and the curator's invisible hand guides experience.

Exhibition making orchestrates:
- Concept development (the why)
- Artist/work selection (the what)
- Spatial design (the where)
- Interpretive materials (the how)
- Public programs (the extension)

Curatorial approaches vary:
- Thematic (idea-driven)
- Survey (comprehensive view)
- Solo (deep dive)
- Group (conversation creation)
- Collection (recontextualization)

Practical considerations constrain:
- Budget limitations
- Space peculiarities
- Insurance requirements
- Conservation needs
- Loan negotiations

Installation creates meaning:
- Height suggests hierarchy
- Proximity implies relationship
- Lighting directs attention
- Color affects mood
- Flow controls narrative

Mediation tools multiply:
- Wall texts (how much?)
- Audio guides (whose voice?)
- Catalogs (lasting document)
- Digital interfaces (engagement)
- Social media (extended reach)

Power dynamics embedded:
- Who selects selector?
- Whose story told?
- Which publics imagined?
- What excluded/included?
- How success measured?

Contemporary exhibition experiments:
- Durational exhibitions
- Online-first shows
- AR/VR integration
- Participatory curation
- Algorithmic selection

Yet core remains: creating temporary worlds where art speaks differently together than alone.
