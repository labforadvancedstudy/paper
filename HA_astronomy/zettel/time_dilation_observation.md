# Time Dilation Observation

## Core Insight
We see time itself slow down in distant supernovae and fast-moving pulsars - Einstein's relativity isn't just theory but observable fact written in astronomical light curves.

Special and general relativity predict time runs differently in different conditions. High speeds and strong gravity slow time. Astronomy provides natural laboratories for testing these predictions. Type Ia supernovae in distant galaxies show time dilation from cosmic expansion. Their light curves - brightening and fading - stretch by factor (1+z) where z is redshift. A supernova at z=1 appears to evolve half as fast as nearby ones.

Pulsars in binary systems show gravitational time dilation. PSR J0737-3039, a double pulsar system, loses energy to gravitational waves exactly as Einstein predicted. GPS satellites experience both effects - speeding up from lower gravity, slowing from orbital velocity. Without relativistic corrections, GPS would drift 10 kilometers daily. Astronomers must account for time dilation when timing pulsars, studying distant explosions, or interpreting cosmological observations. The universe is a testing ground where century-old predictions prove correct to extraordinary precision.
