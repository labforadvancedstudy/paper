# Gravity Well

## Core Insight
The invisible prison of mass - a three-dimensional valley in spacetime that traps objects with relentless pull, requiring enormous energy to escape and shaping every trajectory that passes nearby.

A gravity well isn't really a well - it's a warping of spacetime itself. But the metaphor captures the essential truth: easy to fall in, hard to climb out. Every mass creates one, from asteroids to black holes, and navigating between them defines all space travel.

Earth's well in numbers:
- Surface escape: 11.2 km/s straight up
- LEO escape: 3.2 km/s additional
- Energy to orbit: 32.7 MJ/kg
- Like climbing 3,300 km vertical cliff
- 99% of launch energy fights gravity

The well shapes everything:
- Rocket equation tyranny (exponential fuel needs)
- Oberth effect (burns deeper = more effective)
- Launch sites (equatorial preference)
- Reentry heating (falling back in)
- Orbital mechanics (bound vs escape)

Other wells, other challenges:
- Moon: Shallow (2.4 km/s) but no atmosphere
- Mars: Medium (5.0 km/s) with thin air help
- Jupiter: Death trap (59.5 km/s)
- Sun: Ultimate well (617.5 km/s)
- Black holes: One-way trip past event horizon

Gravity assist exploits wells:
- Steal energy from planets
- Slingshot trajectories
- Trade time for delta-v
- Chain assists for outer system

The philosophical view:
We're bottom-dwellers in Earth's gravity well, looking up at the universe through atmospheric murk. Every space mission is an escape attempt. Every satellite eventually falls back. Every astronaut is a temporary escapee.

Gravity wells are why space is hard. Not distance - gravity. We could reach Alpha Centauri with a bicycle's worth of energy if gravity wells didn't exist. Instead, we need controlled explosions just to reach orbit.
