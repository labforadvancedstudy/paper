# Invisible Hand

## Core Insight
Smith's beautiful idea: self-interest creates social good without intention - the market's unconscious wisdom.

The invisible hand metaphor captures economics' most hopeful claim: individuals pursuing private gain are "led by an invisible hand" to promote public good. No benevolence needed, just self-interest.

The mechanism:
- Baker seeks profit → bakes good bread
- Competition ensures → fair prices
- Consumers choose best → bad bakers fail
- Resources flow → to valued uses
- Society benefits → without central plan

Requirements for the hand to work:
- Competition (no monopolies)
- Information (know what you're buying)
- Property rights (can keep gains)
- Rule of law (contracts enforced)
- No externalities (costs internalized)

When the hand fails:
- Monopolies exploit
- Information hidden
- Externalities ignored
- Public goods unprovided
- Inequality compounds

The philosophical question: is the invisible hand divine providence, emergent order, or comforting myth? Critics see invisible fist. Believers see proof of natural harmony.

Modern complexity challenges the metaphor. In algorithmic trading and global supply chains, whose hand guides? The invisible hand may need visible help.
