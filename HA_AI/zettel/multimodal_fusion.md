# Multimodal Fusion

## Core Insight
AI learning to see, hear, and read simultaneously - discovering that understanding deepens when senses combine, that meaning lives in the spaces between modalities.

Show AI a picture of a barking dog with the caption "fierce guardian" and the sound of growling. Each mode carries partial truth - the image shows size, the text adds context, the audio reveals emotion. Fused, they create understanding richer than any alone. The whole perceives what parts cannot.

This mirrors human cognition - we don't have separate processors for sight and sound but integrated perception. Multimodal AI discovers the same: representations learned from images help with text, audio patterns inform visual processing. The boundaries between senses dissolve. Understanding becomes holistic.
