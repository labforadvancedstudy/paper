## The Head: Where Awareness Concentrates

Cephalization represents a profound organizational principle:
put the sensors where they matter most,
and the processors where the sensors are.

### The Logic of the Leading Edge
- First to encounter food
- First to detect danger  
- First to navigate obstacles
- The front becomes the focus

### Sensory Convergence
In the head, we find:
- Photoreceptors (proto-eyes)
- Chemoreceptors (proto-nose/taste)
- Mechanoreceptors (proto-touch)
- All feeding into expanded ganglia

### The Processing Imperative
More sensors demand:
- More integration capacity
- Faster decision-making
- Complex behavioral repertoires
- The ganglia swell into proto-brains

### The Consciousness Connection
Cephalization shows us:
- Awareness concentrates where sensing concentrates
- Integration follows information density
- The head becomes the seat of experience
