# Fermi Paradox

## Core Insight
The Fermi Paradox isn't just "where is everybody?" - it's the universe's most disturbing question, suggesting either we're cosmically special or cosmically doomed.

The setup is simple:
- Billions of stars in our galaxy
- Many have planets
- Life emerged on Earth quickly
- Intelligence evolved (eventually)
- Galaxy is old enough for multiple civilizations
- Yet... silence

The numbers make no sense. Even at 1% light speed, a civilization could colonize the entire galaxy in 10 million years. The galaxy is 13 billion years old. We should see evidence everywhere: megastructures, radio leakage, probes, visitors. Instead: nothing.

Possible resolutions, each terrifying:
- **Rare Earth**: Life is almost impossibly unlikely
- **Great Filter**: Something kills civilizations (behind or ahead?)
- **Zoo Hypothesis**: They're avoiding us deliberately
- **Transcension**: Civilizations go inward, not outward
- **Dark Forest**: Everyone hides from everyone
- **Simulation**: We're alone because we're programmed to be
- **First**: We're actually the first intelligence

The paradox's real bite: If intelligence is common, where is it? If it's rare, why us? Either answer challenges our cosmic significance.

Every night sky poses the question. Every silent radio telescope deepens it.
