# Universal Basic Income

## Core Insight
UBI is the radical proposition that breaks the ancient link between work and worth - giving everyone money for being human, not for what they produce.

The idea seems absurd. Pay people for nothing? Yet automation makes it urgent. If machines do most work, how do humans earn? If algorithms replace accountants, drivers, doctors, what happens to the displaced? UBI says: pay them anyway.

But UBI is more than economics - it's philosophy. It asserts human value transcends productivity. You deserve resources not because you're useful but because you exist. It's a declaration of inherent worth in an economy increasingly measuring people as costs.

The experiments surprise. Give people free money and most don't quit working. They start businesses, get education, make art, care for family. Freed from survival fear, they often become more productive, not less. The homo economicus model fails again.

Critics raise real concerns. Inflation? Work ethic? Political feasibility? Who pays when robots don't pay taxes? Would meaning collapse without work's structure? Valid questions without clear answers.

Yet UBI represents something profound: the possibility of transcending scarcity psychology. For the first time in history, we might produce enough that everyone could have enough. The question isn't economic but political - will we choose abundance or maintain artificial scarcity?

UBI forces the ultimate question: is the economy for humans or humans for the economy?
