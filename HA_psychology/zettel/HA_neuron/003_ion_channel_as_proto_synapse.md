# 003_ion_channel_as_proto_synapse

## The First Gates of Perception

An ion channel is more than a hole in a membrane -
it's a decision-making apparatus, a proto-computational element
that would evolve into the synapse.

### The Architecture of Choice
- Voltage-gated: Responding to electrical fields
- Ligand-gated: Responding to chemical signals
- Mechanically-gated: Responding to physical force
- Each type a different sensory modality in embryo

### Information Processing Begins
The channel doesn't just open or close - it integrates:
- Multiple signals converge
- Threshold must be reached
- All-or-nothing response
- The first implementation of biological logic

### The Synaptic Prophecy
In the ion channel, we see the synapse's ancestor:
A structure that converts signal to response,
that makes decisions based on input,
that forms the atomic unit of neural computation.
