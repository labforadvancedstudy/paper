# Homeostasis Drive

Body wants balance. Mind ensures it.

Biological drives:
- Hunger: Low glucose → Seek food
- Thirst: High salt → Seek water
- Temperature: Too hot/cold → Adjust
- Sleep: Tired → Rest

Psychological homeostasis:
- Cognitive dissonance → Belief change
- Social rejection → Connection seeking
- Boredom → Stimulation seeking

Set point theory:
Body/mind defend preferred state.
