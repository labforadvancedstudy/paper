# Market Computation

## Core Insight
Markets are humanity's most powerful distributed computer - processing vast amounts of information through millions of parallel processors (humans) to solve the calculation problem no central system could handle.

Think of each economic actor as a neuron. Each purchase is a signal. Each price change propagates information. Together, they're computing solutions to impossibly complex optimization problems: What should be produced? Where? By whom? For whom? The market solves these simultaneously without anyone knowing the full problem.

Price is the output. When corn prices rise, it signals "allocate more resources here." Entrepreneurs are the algorithm adjusters, trying new combinations. Profits and losses are error signals, reinforcing good solutions and eliminating bad ones. Competition is gradient descent, constantly seeking local optima.

This computer has remarkable properties. It's fault-tolerant - individual errors don't crash the system. It's adaptive - changing conditions automatically update calculations. It's scalable - works for villages or global economies. It requires no central processor, no master algorithm, no complete data set.

But like any computer, garbage in means garbage out. Monopolies are like stuck bits. Externalities are uncounted calculations. Information asymmetry corrupts data flow. Financial bubbles are feedback loops gone wild.

The deeper insight: if markets are computers, what are they computing? Maybe they're not optimizing utility or wealth, but discovering what we collectively value through our distributed choices.
