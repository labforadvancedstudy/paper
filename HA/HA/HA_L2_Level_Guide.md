## How to Communicate Across Levels

### If You're Higher Level
1. Find translator one level down
2. Simplify message for them
3. Let them translate further
4. Never skip more than one level

1. Find translator one level up
2. Ask for concrete examples

  - This will be very hard
  - Consider if it's sustainable

### In Learning

## Remember

Your level isn't fixed. You can grow. But:
