# Disgust Rejection

## Core Insight
Disgust is evolution's poison detector - a visceral "DO NOT WANT" that kept our ancestors alive.

That wrinkled nose, that stomach turn, that automatic recoil - disgust doesn't negotiate. It's older than language, deeper than thought. Originally for rotten food and bodily waste, now it judges moral violations too. We feel "disgusted" by cheaters and liars because our brain recycles the same ancient rejection circuit. It's why "that leaves a bad taste" works for both spoiled milk and bad behavior.
