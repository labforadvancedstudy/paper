# Values

## Core Insight
The preferences evolution carved into us, refined by reason, distorted by culture.

## The Compass We Build

Values don't exist in nature. No atom is good or bad. No molecule is just or unjust. Yet we navigate by these invented stars.

L1: Good is what feels good
L2: Good is what gods command
L3: Good is virtue/excellence
L4: Good is universal law
L5: Good is authentic choice
L6: "Good" is socially constructed
L7: Values mask power relations
L8: Values are optimization targets
L9: Values are strange attractors

The evolutionary hack: creatures who valued survival survived. Now we argue whether survival is valuable.
