## The Rhythm of Awareness

Neural oscillations reveal how separate
processing streams unite into coherent experience -
the solution to consciousness's binding problem.

### The Binding Problem
- Color processed here, shape there
- Motion in another region entirely
- Yet we see unified objects
- How does the brain bind features?

### Oscillation as Solution
- Neurons processing same object synchronize
- Different frequencies for different features
- Phase-locking creates temporal binding
- Unity through synchrony

### Frequency Bands, Different Functions
- Delta (1-4 Hz): Deep sleep, unconscious
- Theta (4-8 Hz): Memory, navigation
- Alpha (8-12 Hz): Relaxed awareness
- Beta (12-30 Hz): Active thinking
- Gamma (30-100 Hz): Conscious perception

### The Consciousness Connection
Oscillations suggest:
- Consciousness has temporal structure
- Binding creates unified experience
- Disrupted rhythms, disrupted awareness
