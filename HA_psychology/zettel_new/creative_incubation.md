# Creative Incubation: Unconscious Processing

**Core Concept**: Stepping away from a problem allows unconscious processing to find solutions.

## One-Line Definition
Your brain solves problems in the background while you're not trying.

## Simple Mental Model
Like slow-cooking - conscious effort is prep work, then you must leave it alone to transform. Checking constantly prevents the magic.

## Key Mechanism
1. Conscious work loads problem
2. Attention shifts elsewhere
3. Unconscious processing continues
4. Solution emerges "suddenly"

## Practical Example
Struggling with code all day, give up in frustration. Solution pops into mind during shower. The break wasn't procrastination - it was necessary processing time.

## Common Misconception
Incubation is just rest or luck. Actually, brain imaging shows intense unconscious activity during incubation - different networks activate when conscious control relaxes.
