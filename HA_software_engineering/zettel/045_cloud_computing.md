- **Level**: L5
- **Definition**: Someone else's computer, brilliantly marketed
- **Korean**: 클라우드 컴퓨팅
- **Context**: The return to mainframe computing, but with better branding

## Core Understanding
Cloud computing is the technology industry's greatest magic trick: convincing everyone that servers become mystical when you can't see them. It's renting computers with extra steps, where "elastic scalability" means your credit card can stretch infinitely. The cloud is just underground data centers with good PR.

## Deeper Insights
- **Shared Responsibility Model**: You're responsible when things break, they're responsible for billing
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Hotel California architecture—you can check out anytime, but your data can never leave
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically scaling your costs faster than your traffic
- **Serverless**: Servers that definitely exist but we pretend they don't

## Technical Details
```terraform
# Infrastructure as Code: Writing poetry about servers
resource "aws_instance" "existential_crisis" {
  ami           = "ami-12345"  # Amazon Machine Image of Sisyphus
  instance_type = "t3.micro"   # Micro aggression against your wallet
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "schrodingers-server"
    Purpose     = "unknown"
    Cost-Center = "your-life-savings"
    Managed-By  = "hopes-and-prayers"
  }
  
  user_data = <<-EOF
    #!/bin/bash
    # This script runs on boot
    echo "I think therefore I am... in us-east-1"
    
    # Install everything
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y universe
    
    # Set up monitoring to watch yourself fail
    curl https://monitoring.io/install.sh | sudo bash
    
    # Configure auto-healing (spoiler: it won't work)
    systemctl enable denial
    systemctl start acceptance
  EOF
  
  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = false  # Everything is temporary
    create_before_destroy = true  # Optimistic
    ignore_changes = [
      credit_card_charges,  # Don't look at the bill
    ]
  }
}

# The cloud bill calculator
output "monthly_cost" {
  value = "∞"
  description = "A number you'll only understand after it's too late"
}
```

## Connection to Truth
The cloud represents humanity's eternal desire to abstract away complexity—to push our problems up the stack until they become someone else's responsibility. It's the technological manifestation of "ignorance is bliss," where we trade control for convenience and ownership for OpEx.

## When It Matters
- **Startup Life**: When you have no money for servers but somehow have money for cloud
- **Scale Events**: Black Friday, viral moments, the Slashdot effect
- **Global Reach**: Serving content from the edge (of bankruptcy)
- **Innovation Theater**: "We're cloud-native" sounds better than "we rent computers"

## Human Element
Cloud computing has created a new priesthood: the DevOps engineers who speak in YAML and terraform the digital landscape. They've replaced the server room shamans who knew which rack to kick. Now our prayers are automated, our offerings metered by the millisecond, and our sacrifices measured in AWS credits.
