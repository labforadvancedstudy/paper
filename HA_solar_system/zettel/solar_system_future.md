# Solar System Future

## Core Insight
The Solar System's future is written in physics - the Sun will die, planets will freeze or burn, but the timeline stretches so far that "permanent" and "temporary" lose meaning.

In a billion years, the brightening Sun will boil Earth's oceans. In five billion years, the Sun will swell into a red giant, possibly engulfing Earth, certainly scorching it. Then it will shed its outer layers, becoming a white dwarf surrounded by planetary nebula. The planets will orbit a stellar corpse, frozen in eternal night. Eventually, gravitational perturbations from passing stars will strip planets away, sending them into interstellar void.

But "eventually" means trillions of years. The far future is stranger: proton decay might dissolve all matter. Black holes will evaporate through Hawking radiation. The universe will reach maximum entropy. In this ultimate timeline, our Solar System's billions of years of existence shrinks to an eye-blink. We live in the brief cosmic spring when stars shine and life is possible. The Solar System's death is certain, but so distant it becomes philosophy rather than prediction.
