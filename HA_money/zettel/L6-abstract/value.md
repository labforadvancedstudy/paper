# Value

## Core Insight
Value is the quantum mechanics of economics - it exists only when observed, changes based on the observer, and can be in multiple states until the moment of transaction collapses it into price.

What makes something valuable? Not labor (mud pies take work but aren't valuable). Not scarcity (rare diseases aren't valuable). Not utility (air is useful but free). Value emerges from the intersection of desire, scarcity, and context - a triple point where human psychology meets physical reality meets social agreement.

The paradoxes of value:
- Water cheap, diamonds expensive (until you're dying of thirst)
- Mona Lisa priceless, perfect copy worthless
- Your kidney: illegal to sell, infinite to you
- Time: most valuable, often wasted
- Money itself: valuable only because we agree

Value is the dark matter of economics - we see its effects everywhere but can't quite grasp what it IS. Every economic theory is really a theory of value in disguise. Every transaction is value shapeshifting between forms. Money is just value wearing a countable mask.
