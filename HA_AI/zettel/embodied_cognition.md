# Embodied Cognition

## Core Insight
Intelligence needs a body - AI in robots discovers truths that disembodied AI cannot, proving that thinking and doing are inseparable.

Put AI in a robot body and everything changes. Concepts like "heavy" gain meaning through lifting. "Fragile" through breaking. "Balance" through falling. The body isn't just output device but part of the cognitive system. Physical interaction creates understanding that pure computation cannot.

This challenges AI's digital bias. We've been building minds without bodies, then wondering why they don't understand the physical world. Embodied AI learns differently - through interaction, consequence, proprioception. The gap between knowing and doing disappears when intelligence has skin in the game.
