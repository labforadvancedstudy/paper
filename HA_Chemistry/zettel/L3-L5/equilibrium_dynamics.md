# Equilibrium Dynamics

## Core Insight
Chemical equilibrium is a dynamic balance - reactions never stop, they just run equally in both directions.

A sealed bottle of soda looks static. It's not. CO2 molecules constantly leave the liquid, enter the gas phase. Simultaneously, gas molecules redissolve. When rates match, nothing seems to change. But zoom in - it's molecular chaos in perfect balance.

Le Chatelier's principle: disturb equilibrium, it shifts to compensate. Add pressure, it shifts to reduce volume. Add heat to endothermic reaction, it shifts forward to absorb heat. Remove product, it makes more. The system fights change.

This isn't just chemistry - it's economics, ecology, everything. Supply and demand, predator and prey, all equilibrium systems. Understanding chemical equilibrium reveals universal principles of balance and response.
