# Cognitive Development

Mind construction over time.

Piaget's stages:
- Sensorimotor (0-2): Action thinking
- Preoperational (2-7): Symbolic thinking
- Concrete operational (7-11): Logical thinking
- Formal operational (11+): Abstract thinking

Not rigid stages.
More like overlapping waves.

Vygotsky's zone:
Proximal development.
Can do with help → Can do alone.

Brain develops until 25.
