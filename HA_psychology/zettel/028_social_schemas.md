# Social Schemas

Mental templates for people.

Types:
- Person schemas: Trait expectations
- Role schemas: Teacher, doctor, parent
- Event schemas: Restaurant script
- Self-schemas: Identity templates

Stereotypes = Overgeneralized schemas.

Schema effects:
- Guide attention
- Fill gaps
- Resist change
- Self-fulfilling

Useful but limiting.
Efficiency vs accuracy tradeoff.
