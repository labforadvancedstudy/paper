# Political Economy

## Core Insight
Political economy recognizes that power and wealth are conjoined twins - economic systems shape political ones, political decisions create economic outcomes, and both dance together in an eternal feedback loop.

The separation of politics and economics is itself a political choice. Every market exists within a political framework. Property rights? Political creation. Money? Political backing. Contracts? Political enforcement. The "free market" is politically constructed and maintained.

But it goes deeper. Economic power becomes political power. Wealthy individuals and corporations lobby, donate, influence. They shape the rules that govern markets. Political power becomes economic power. Regulators become lobbyists. Politicians become board members. The revolving door spins.

This creates what political economists call "capture" - when those meant to be regulated control the regulators. Banks too big to fail. Tech monopolies too connected to break up. Energy companies writing environmental laws. The referee joins one of the teams.

Different political systems create different economies. Democracy tends toward redistribution (voters are mostly non-rich). Autocracy concentrates wealth (power protects itself). But even democracies vary - proportional representation creates different economic policies than winner-take-all.

The fundamental tension: democratic politics (one person, one vote) meets capitalist economics (one dollar, one vote). When they conflict, which wins? The answer shapes everything from tax rates to climate policy.
