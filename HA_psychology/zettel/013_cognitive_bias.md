# Cognitive Bias

Thinking shortcuts that mislead.

Common biases:
- Confirmation: See what we expect
- Anchoring: First info weighs heavy
- Availability: Recent = probable
- Hindsight: Knew it all along
- Fundamental attribution: You're bad, I had reasons

Evolutionary shortcuts.
Usually helpful, sometimes harmful.

Debiasing difficult.
Knowing ≠ immunity.

Metacognition helps.
