# 002 Action Potential - Electric Pulse

The fundamental unit of neural communication. A wave of electrochemical 
excitation racing down the axon at ~120 m/s.

## Mechanism
- Resting: -70mV (Na+ out, K+ in)
- Depolarization: Na+ channels open
- Peak: +40mV reversal
- Repolarization: K+ efflux
- Hyperpolarization: Brief undershoot

## Information Encoding
All-or-nothing binary signal. Information in:
- Frequency (rate coding)
- Timing (temporal coding)
- Synchrony (population coding)

## Significance
Digital computation in analog wetware. The bit of the brain.
Energy cost: ~10^9 ATP per spike. Evolution wouldn't pay unless critical.
