# Reform

## Core Insight
Change within the system - the attempt to fix politics without breaking it, to transform while preserving, to revolution in slow motion.

Reform occupies the anxious middle ground between stasis and revolution. Too little change and pressure builds toward explosion. Too much and the system destabilizes. Reformers walk a tightrope over chaos.

The reform paradox: you must use the system to change the system. This means:
- Working with those who benefit from status quo
- Following procedures designed to prevent change  
- Accepting legitimacy of what you're trying to fix
- Moving slowly when problems are urgent
- Compromising on principles

Types of reform:
- Incremental (small steps over time)
- Structural (changing the architecture)
- Cultural (shifting values and norms)
- Legal (rewriting the rules)
- Administrative (improving implementation)

Reform's psychological burden: reformers get attacked from both sides. Conservatives say they go too far, radicals say not far enough. They're sellouts to revolutionaries, dangerous to reactionaries.

Yet reform has achievements revolution often lacks: durability. What's built slowly and with broad buy-in tends to last. Revolutionary changes imposed by force often collapse when force weakens.

The deeper question: is reform just system maintenance, co-opting discontent to preserve power structures? Or is it genuine progress, the art of the possible in an imperfect world?

Perhaps both. Reform can be cynical pressure release or sincere improvement. Often it's both simultaneously - which is why it's so unsatisfying and so necessary.
