# modularity

**Level**: L4  
**Domain**: Software Engineering

## Core Concept
The art of building with interchangeable parts - decomposing systems into discrete, composable units.

## Irreducible Truth
Modularity is divide and conquer applied to complexity. It makes the incomprehensible comprehensible through boundaries.

## Metaphysical Structure
- **Ontology**: Systems are compositions of subsystems
- **Epistemology**: We understand wholes through parts
- **Axiology**: Modularity enables parallel work and thought

## Practical Implementation
```python
# Modular architecture
# auth/module.py
class AuthModule:
    def authenticate(self, credentials):
        # Self-contained authentication logic
        pass

# payment/module.py  
class PaymentModule:
    def process_payment(self, amount, method):
        # Self-contained payment logic
        pass

# notification/module.py
class NotificationModule:
    def send_notification(self, user, message):
        # Self-contained notification logic
        pass

# main.py - Compose modules
class Application:
    def __init__(self):
        self.auth = AuthModule()
        self.payment = PaymentModule()
        self.notification = NotificationModule()
    
    def complete_purchase(self, user, item):
        if self.auth.authenticate(user):
            if self.payment.process_payment(item.price, user.payment_method):
                self.notification.send_notification(user, "Purchase complete!")
```

## HA Integration
HA treats modularity as the fundamental principle of manageable complexity - the recognition that understanding requires boundaries.

## Key Insights
1. Modules should be deep: simple interface, complex implementation
2. The ideal module can be understood in isolation
3. Microservices are modularity over a network
