# Art Time

## Core Insight
Chronology shattered - where past, present, and future collapse into eternal now, making art humanity's time machine that moves in all directions simultaneously.

Time operations in art:
- Freezing moments
- Extending duration
- Compressing epochs
- Reversing sequence
- Creating eternities
- Destroying linear
- Opening portals

Temporal paradoxes:
- Ancient feels contemporary
- New already old
- Dead artists present
- Future remembered
- Now stretched infinite
- Then collapsed here
- When becomes where

Different art times:
- Making time (process)
- Viewing time (encounter)
- Historical time (context)
- Decay time (entropy)
- Memory time (recall)
- Market time (value)
- Eternal time (transcendent)

Time-based media:
- Performance duration
- Video loops
- Film sequences
- Sound passages
- Digital clocks
- Decay processes
- Growth patterns

Conservation fights time:
- Stopping inevitable
- Preserving changing
- Fixing fluid
- Denying entropy
- Controlling uncontrollable
- Museum as freezer
- Time wins always

Contemporary time:
- Acceleration anxiety
- Instant global
- Archive everything
- Memory outsourced
- Present disappeared
- Future collapsed
- Past searchable

Art's time gift:
- Slowing perception
- Extending attention
- Connecting epochs
- Transcending mortality
- Creating duration
- Offering eternities
- Teaching patience

Time reveals art's magic: Makes past present, future now. Vermeer's light still morning. Pollock's gesture still falling. Art doesn't stop time - transforms it.
