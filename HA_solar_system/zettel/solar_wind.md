# Solar Wind

## Core Insight
The Sun breathes charged particles at a million miles per hour - an invisible hurricane that inflates a bubble around our Solar System and sculpts everything within it.

The solar wind is the Sun's extended atmosphere, too hot to be held by gravity. Electrons and protons stream outward, carrying magnetic fields, creating a vast heliosphere that extends beyond Pluto. This isn't gentle breeze but supersonic plasma, stripping atmospheres from unprotected worlds, pushing comet tails away from the Sun, painting auroras on magnetized planets.

Earth's magnetic field deflects this wind like a cosmic umbrella, channeling particles to poles where they excite atmospheric gases into northern lights. Without this protection, solar wind would have stripped our atmosphere like it did to Mars. The wind varies with the Sun's mood - gentle during solar minimum, stormy during maximum. We live inside a star's exhalation, protected by magnetic shields from our star's breath.
