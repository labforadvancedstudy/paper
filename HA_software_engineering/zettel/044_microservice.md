# microservice
- **Level**: L5
- **Definition**: The city of small, specialized programs
- **Korean**: 마이크로서비스
- **Context**: What happens when you solve organizational problems with technical solutions

## Core Understanding
Microservices are like converting a monolithic novel into a thousand Post-it notes scattered across different rooms, with each note calling the others by phone to figure out the plot. It's architectural democracy where every service gets a vote, and consensus is achieved through network timeouts.

## Deeper Insights
- **Service Boundaries**: Drawing lines in imaginary sand
- **Network Complexity**: Every function call is now a prayer to the network gods
- **Data Consistency**: Eventually... maybe... hopefully
- **Operational Overhead**: One app becomes a hundred problems

## Connection to Truth
Microservices embody the human tendency to solve complexity with more complexity. Like society itself, we break apart the monolith only to discover we've created a distributed monolith with extra steps. It's Conway's Law made manifest: our software architecture mirrors our organizational dysfunction.

## When It Matters
- **Team Scaling**: When too many cooks need separate kitchens
- **Technology Diversity**: Let a thousand frameworks bloom
- **Independent Deployment**: Ship your bugs faster
- **Failure Isolation**: Limit the blast radius

## Human Element
Microservices are sold as a technical solution but are really about people. Can't decide who owns the user model? Make three user services! Teams can't agree on languages? Everyone gets their favorite! It's architectural therapy that creates operational trauma. The distributed system is really distributing responsibility until no one knows who to blame.
