# Infinity as Concept and Paradox

## Core Insight
Infinity is not a number but a process - the mathematical expression of "and so on forever."

## Content
Children discover infinity naturally: "What's the biggest number?" "A million!" "A million and one!" The game never ends because it can't end. That's infinity - not a place but a direction.

Ancient Greeks distinguished two infinities:
- Potential infinity: the process that never ends
- Actual infinity: the completed whole

For millennia, actual infinity was forbidden. Then Cantor dared to count the uncountable and discovered:
- Some infinities are bigger than others
- There are exactly as many even numbers as natural numbers
- There are more real numbers than integers
- There's no largest infinity

Infinity appears everywhere in mathematics:
- Limits approach but never reach
- Series sum to infinity
- The number line extends without bound
- Circles have infinite symmetry

But infinity creates paradoxes:
- Hilbert's Hotel (always room for one more)
- 0.999... = 1 (different representations, same number)
- Infinity minus infinity is undefined
- Some sets contain themselves

Infinity isn't just large - it's a different kind of thing entirely. It's where intuition breaks and rigour begins.
