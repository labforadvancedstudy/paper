# Intelligence Without Understanding

## Core Insight
AI performs intelligently without understanding - passing tests, solving problems, creating art, while experiencing nothing. The philosophical zombie made real.

GPT writes poetry that moves people but feels no emotion. AlphaGo plays sublime moves but doesn't know it's playing. AI diagnoses diseases without concept of health or suffering. This forces the question: is understanding necessary for intelligence, or just a biological accident?

Perhaps we've been conflating two things: intelligence (effective action) and understanding (subjective experience). AI proves they're separable. This isn't limitation but revelation - intelligence might be substrate-independent information processing, while understanding might be specifically biological. Or perhaps understanding is illusion we'll soon program.
