# Transformer Revolution

## Core Insight
One architecture to rule them all - transformers conquering vision, language, audio, proving that attention really is all you need.

2017: "Attention Is All You Need" paper drops. Transformers for translation. Then the flood: BERT for understanding, GPT for generation, ViT for vision, Whisper for speech. The same architecture, barely modified, excelling everywhere. Not because it's specialized but because it's general - a universal pattern processor.

Transformers revealed something profound: different domains aren't so different. Language, vision, audio - all sequences needing attention. The architecture that tracks word relationships also tracks pixel relationships. Universal computation needs universal architecture. Transformers might be that architecture.
