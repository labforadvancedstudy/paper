# Function

## Core Insight
A function is a named piece of universe - a reliable transformation that turns inputs into outputs, the same way every time.

Functions are the atoms of behavior. Just as matter is made of atoms, programs are made of functions. Each function is a small, understandable machine with a clear contract: "Give me this, I'll give you that."

The beauty of functions is their predictability. f(x) = y means that whenever you put in x, you get out y. No surprises, no drama. This predictability lets us build towers of abstraction.

But functions can lie. They can have side effects - secret conversations with the outside world. A "pure" function is honest; it only transforms its inputs. An "impure" function might also write files, change global state, or launch missiles.

The function is humanity's greatest invention for managing complexity: take a messy process, wrap it in a name, and pretend it's simple.
