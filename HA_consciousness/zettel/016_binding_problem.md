# 016 Binding Problem - Unity from Many

How does distributed processing create unified experience?
The central mystery of consciousness.

## The Problem
- Color processed in V4
- Motion in MT
- Shape in IT
- Yet we see one unified object

## Proposed Solutions
- **Temporal binding**: Synchronous firing (40Hz)
- **Feature integration**: Attention as glue
- **Convergence zones**: Higher areas combine
- **Global workspace**: Broadcast creates unity

## Evidence
- Binocular rivalry: Only one percept at a time
- Change blindness: Unity is constructed
- Split-brain: Unity can be divided
- Synesthesia: Abnormal binding

## Significance
Binding = the difference between parallel processing and
unified consciousness. How the brain solves it might be
how consciousness emerges.

Many become one, and that one is you.
