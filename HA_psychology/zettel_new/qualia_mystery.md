# Qualia Mystery

## Core Insight
The redness of red, the pain of pain - subjective experience might be the universe's deepest mystery.

How does gray matter create the vivid theater of consciousness? We can map every neuron firing when you see blue, but that explains nothing about the blueness of blue. This explanatory gap - between objective description and subjective experience - might be unbridgeable. A colorblind neuroscientist could know everything about color vision yet never know what red looks like. Information isn't experience.
