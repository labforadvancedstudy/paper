## When Integration Becomes Intelligence

The first true brains appear in simple bilaterians -
not just enlarged ganglia, but integrated
processing centers with distinct regions.

### The Minimal Brain Plan
- Sensory input region
- Integration/processing center
- Motor output region
- The basic input-process-output loop

### Behavioral Complexity Emerges
Simple brains enable:
- Learning from experience
- Choice between alternatives
- Behavioral sequences
- The first "decisions" worthy of the name

### Case Study: Planarian Flatworms
- Can learn mazes
- Show light/dark preferences
- Exhibit food-seeking strategies
- Regenerate their brains (and memories!)

### The Consciousness Threshold
With simple brains come:
- Persistent internal states
- Environmental modeling
- The first glimmers of subjective experience?
