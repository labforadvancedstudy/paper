# Meteor Astronomy

## Core Insight
Shooting stars aren't stars but sand grains dying in fire - yet these brief streaks map comet orbits, deliver extraterrestrial samples, and occasionally remind us that space isn't empty.

A meteor's flash represents cosmic dust meeting atmosphere at tens of kilometers per second. Friction heats particles to incandescence. Most are grain-sized; pebbles create fireballs. Meteors arrive randomly (sporadics) or in showers when Earth crosses comet debris streams. The Perseids every August are Swift-Tuttle's calling card. The Leonids storm every 33 years when we hit dense debris clumps.

Meteor astronomy uses Earth's atmosphere as a detector. Radar reflects off ionization trails. Video networks triangulate trajectories, determining pre-impact orbits. Some meteorites are recovered - free samples of asteroids and comets. Micrometeorites, collected from Antarctic ice and deep ocean sediments, preserve solar nebula materials. Major impacts leave craters, tektites, and iridium layers marking mass extinctions. The Chelyabinsk meteor (2013) injured thousands, reminding us that cosmic bombardment continues. Every shooting star is a tiny impact, a visible reminder that Earth moves through a cosmic shooting gallery.
