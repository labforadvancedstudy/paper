# Technological Evolution

## Core Insight
Technology evolves like life but faster - each innovation is a mutation, the market is natural selection, and obsolescence is extinction in fast-forward.

Technologies reproduce through manufacturing, mutate through innovation, compete for resources (human attention, capital, materials). The fittest survive - not strongest but most adapted to human needs. It's Darwinism at silicon speed.

The pattern repeats: emergence (invention), radiation (varieties proliferate), competition (market battle), dominance (standard emerges), obsolescence (next paradigm appears). From stone tools to smartphones: same evolutionary algorithm, accelerating tempo.

Unlike biological evolution, technological evolution is Lamarckian - acquired improvements pass to offspring. Each phone inherits all previous phone innovations plus new ones. This creates exponential improvement curves biology can't match.
