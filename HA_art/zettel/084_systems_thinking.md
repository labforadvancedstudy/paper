# Systems Thinking

## Core Insight
The whole exceeding parts - where art becomes visible as interconnected networks of relationships, feedback loops, and emergent properties rather than isolated objects.

Systems principles:
- Holism over reduction
- Relationships matter
- Feedback loops operate
- Emergence happens
- Boundaries permeable

Art world as system:
- Artists (producers)
- Institutions (validators)
- Markets (exchangers)
- Critics (interpreters)
- Publics (receivers)

System dynamics:
- Input/output flows
- Positive feedback (amplification)
- Negative feedback (regulation)
- Time delays
- Unintended consequences

Artwork as system:
- Material components
- Conceptual framework
- Context relations
- Viewer interaction
- Meaning circulation

Ecological thinking:
- Art ecosystems
- Cultural metabolism
- Sustainability questions
- Waste products
- Regeneration cycles

Cybernetic art:
- Feedback systems
- Interactive environments
- Self-organizing works
- Adaptive behaviors
- Network effects

Systems art history:
- Burnham's software
- Haacke's polls
- Latham's evolution
- Ascott's telematic
- Jeremijenko's experiments

Contemporary systems:
- Platform ecologies
- Attention economies
- Viral propagation
- Algorithmic curation
- Blockchain verification

Critical perspectives:
- Power distributions
- Access points
- System boundaries
- Excluded elements
- Change possibilities

Systems thinking reveals: Art isn't things but relationships. Not products but processes. Not static but dynamic. Understanding systems enables intervention.
