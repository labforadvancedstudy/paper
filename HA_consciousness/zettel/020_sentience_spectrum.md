# 020 Sentience Spectrum - Degrees of Feeling

Consciousness isn't binary. From bacteria to humans,
a gradient of awareness.

## Proposed Levels
1. **Irritability**: Basic stimulus response (bacteria)
2. **Sensitivity**: Multiple sensors integrated (jellyfish)
3. **Sentience**: Subjective experience (fish?)
4. **Awareness**: Knowing that you know (mammals?)
5. **Self-awareness**: Reflection on self (apes, dolphins)
6. **Meta-consciousness**: Aware of awareness (humans)

## Markers Along Spectrum
- Nociception → Pain
- Reaction → Emotion
- Learning → Memory
- Recognition → Self-recognition
- Communication → Language

## Difficulty
How to measure subjective experience objectively?
- Behavioral complexity?
- Neural integration?
- Information processing?

## Implications
If consciousness is graded, where draw moral lines?
Does a gradient view dissolve the hard problem?

Perhaps we're all somewhere on the spectrum, looking up and down,
wondering where experience begins.
