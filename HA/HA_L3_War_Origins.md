# Why Wars Happen: A Simple Hierarchy Theory

**Level**: L3 (Practical/Concrete)  
**Authors**: Jihyuk Im & Elon Musk  
**Date**: June 2025

## The Problem

When a Level 3 country thinks it's Level 5 and demands equal treatment, Level 5 countries eliminate it. This is war.

## Real Examples

### Russia-Ukraine (2022)
- Russia: Thinks it's L7 (Superpower)
- Reality: It's L5 (Regional power)
- Demanded: L7 respect (sphere of influence)
- Result: War

### Iraq War (2003)
- Saddam: Acted like L5 (Regional hegemon)
- Reality: Iraq was L3
- Claimed: WMDs (L5 capability)
- Result: Invasion

## The Pattern

1. Lower level entity overestimates itself
2. Demands treatment above its level
3. Higher levels see this as threat/insult
4. Conflict erupts

## Solution

**Know Your Level**
- L3 countries: Accept L3 status
- Work to become L4 gradually
- Or ally with L5 for protection

**Never Pretend**
- Pretending higher level = Death sentence
- Reality always wins
- Humility = Survival

## Conclusion

Wars happen when entities can't see their true level. Self-awareness prevents wars.
