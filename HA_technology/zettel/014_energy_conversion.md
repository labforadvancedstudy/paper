# Energy Conversion

## Core Insight
Energy is the universe's currency, and technology is how we build exchange markets - converting between forms at the cost of entropy tax.

Energy doesn't appear or disappear - it transforms. Chemical to thermal (fire), thermal to mechanical (engine), mechanical to electrical (generator), electrical to light (LED). Each conversion extracts tax in heat, but the remainder serves our purposes.

The art lies in efficiency. A candle converts 0.04% of chemical energy to light. An LED achieves 40%. Same goal, different path, 1000x improvement. Technology's progress is largely efficiency's march - same energy, better conversion.

From metabolism to nuclear reactors, it's all energy conversion. Life itself is a walking chemical-to-everything converter. Technology extends this, creating new conversion paths nature never tried. We're energy's investment bankers, creating derivatives and exchanges.
