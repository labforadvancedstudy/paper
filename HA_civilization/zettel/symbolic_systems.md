# Symbolic Systems

## Core Insight
Symbols are civilization's DNA - arbitrary marks that carry meaning across minds and millennia.

A flag is just colored cloth, but people die for it. A crown is just metal, but it commands armies. Symbols work because we agree they work. They're collective hallucinations with real-world power.

Symbols compress complex ideas into simple forms. A cross contains all of Christianity. A dollar sign contains all of capitalism. E=mc² contains the universe's most powerful secret. Symbols let us think thoughts too big for words.

But symbols also control us. Once a symbol gains power, it shapes behavior more than reality. People kill for flags, die for crosses, sacrifice everything for symbolic victories. Civilization runs on symbol-magic.
