# Addition as Combination

## Core Insight
Addition is the formalization of "putting together" - the mathematical expression of accumulation.

## Content
Before symbols, before "plus," there was the act: push two piles together, count again. Addition isn't invented; it's abstracted from this primitive gesture.

2 + 3 = 5 seems obvious, but consider what's happening:
- We agree that "2" means ●●
- We agree that "3" means ●●●
- We agree that pushing them together and recounting gives "5"
- The universe doesn't argue

Addition has properties we take for granted:
- Order doesn't matter: 2 + 3 = 3 + 2 (commutativity)
- Grouping doesn't matter: (2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4) (associativity)
- Zero does nothing: 5 + 0 = 5 (identity)

These aren't rules we imposed - they're patterns we noticed. The universe seems to have opinions about how combining should work.
