# Drake Equation

## Core Insight
The Drake Equation doesn't calculate the number of alien civilizations - it organizes our ignorance about life in the universe into a framework that transforms wild speculation into systematic uncertainty.

N = R* × fp × ne × fl × fi × fc × L. Each term represents a step from stars to signals: star formation rate, fraction with planets, number of habitable planets, fraction developing life, fraction developing intelligence, fraction developing communication, civilization lifetime. Multiply these and get... anything from 1 to millions, depending on assumptions.

The equation's power isn't in answering but in asking. It breaks the overwhelming question "Are we alone?" into manageable pieces. We know some terms now (most stars have planets). Others remain mysterious (fraction developing life). The equation revealed that finding aliens is as much about sociology (how long civilizations last) as astronomy. In trying to estimate alien numbers, we confront our ignorance about life's probability, intelligence's inevitability, and civilization's sustainability. Drake organized the search for cosmic company.
