# The Quest for AGI
## Core Insight
Artificial General Intelligence isn't just harder AI - it's qualitatively different, requiring flexibility, transfer, and perhaps consciousness.

## What Makes Intelligence General?

**Current AI**: Narrow excellence
- Chess master can't play checkers
- Language model can't see
- Vision model can't reason
- Each brilliant, none general

**AGI Requirements**:
- Learn any task
- Transfer knowledge
- Common sense
- Self-awareness?
- Goals and desires?

The last two: Nobody knows if needed.

## Approaches to AGI

**Scale hypothesis**: Enough parameters → AGI
**Hybrid systems**: Combine specialized modules
**Cognitive architecture**: Model human mind
**Embodied AI**: Intelligence needs body
**Consciousness first**: Awareness required

Each assumes different essence.

## The Benchmarks Problem

How test AGI?
- Turing test (foolable)
- Human-level performance (which human?)
- Economic value (narrow metric)
- Scientific discovery (getting closer)
- Self-improvement (dangerous metric)

We'll know it when we see it?

## Timeline Predictions

Expert estimates:
- 10% say: Never
- 25% say: 10-20 years
- 50% say: 20-50 years
- 15% say: Already here, unrecognized

Uncertainty is only certainty.

## Why It Matters

AGI changes everything:
- Science accelerates exponentially
- All problems become solvable?
- Human purpose questioned
- Power concentration risk
- Consciousness questions urgent

Species-defining moment approaching.
