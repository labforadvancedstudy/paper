# Spacecraft

## Core Insight
A temporary bubble of function in the permanent hostility of space - the integrated system that must provide all necessities for survival and mission success while weighing as little as possible and working perfectly the first time.

A spacecraft is the ultimate expression of systems engineering. Every subsystem must work with every other, with no option for roadside assistance. It's a miniature world that must generate power, maintain temperature, communicate, navigate, and accomplish its mission while surviving an environment that attacks every weakness.

The anatomy of survival:
- **Structure**: The skeleton holding it together
- **Power**: Solar panels or RTGs feeding everything
- **Thermal**: Radiators and heaters balancing temperature
- **ADCS**: Attitude determination and control
- **C&DH**: Command and data handling (the brain)
- **Communications**: The link to Earth
- **Propulsion**: For moving and station-keeping
- **Payload**: The reason it exists

Every spacecraft is bespoke:
- Earth observer: Big optics, precise pointing
- Deep space probe: RTG power, high-gain antenna
- Mars rover: Wheels, robotics, sample systems
- Crew vehicle: Life support dominates mass
- CubeSat: Miniaturized everything

The design spiral:
1. Mission drives requirements
2. Requirements size subsystems
3. Subsystems demand resources
4. Resources increase mass
5. Mass demands more propulsion
6. Iterate until converged (or budget exhausted)

Integration is where problems multiply:
- Thermal expansion mismatches
- Electromagnetic interference
- Structural resonances
- Power budget conflicts
- Software complexity explosion

The unforgiving scoreboard:
- ~50% of Mars missions have failed
- Software errors kill functioning hardware
- Single part failure can doom mission
- No spacecraft is ever "finished"
- Success means everything worked

Spacecraft are humanity's most complex mobile creations, operating in the least forgiving environment, with no second chances.
