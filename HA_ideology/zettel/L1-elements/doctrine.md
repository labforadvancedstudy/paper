# Doctrine

## Core Insight
Crystallized belief made mandatory - when fluid ideas solidify into fixed rules that must be followed, taught, and defended without deviation.

Doctrine is ideology's skeleton. It takes living thought and hardens it into bone:
- This is what we believe
- This is why we believe it
- This is what follows from belief
- This is what contradicts belief
- This is how to tell friend from enemy

Watch doctrine form: A leader speaks. Followers interpret. Disagreements arise. Clarifications issued. Official positions declared. Gradually, spontaneous insight becomes codified truth. The movement that began in freedom ends in catechism.

Doctrine serves multiple functions:
- Unity (everyone believes the same)
- Identity (we believe this, they don't)
- Authority (who interprets doctrine)
- Action (what doctrine demands)
- Defense (protecting pure doctrine)

The paradox: doctrine preserves ideas by killing them. The living thought that inspired followers becomes the dead letter that constrains them. Yet without doctrine, movements dissolve into confusion. The price of coherence is rigidity.

Every ideology faces the doctrine dilemma: too little, and you're shapeless; too much, and you're lifeless.
