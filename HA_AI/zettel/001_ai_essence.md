# Essence of AI
## Core Insight
AI is humanity's attempt to recreate intelligence - not copy human intelligence, but discover what intelligence itself is.

## What AI Really Is

Beyond the hype:
- **Pattern recognition** at scale
- **Optimization** of objectives
- **Prediction** from data
- **Automation** of cognition

But deeper: The universe understanding its own understanding.

## The AI Paradox

We're trying to:
- Define intelligence (we can't)
- Measure intelligence (culturally biased)
- Create intelligence (but which kind?)
- Recognize intelligence (Turing test?)

Building what we don't understand.

## Types of AI

**Narrow AI** (Now): Specific tasks
- Chess playing
- Image recognition
- Language processing
- Recommendation

**General AI** (Goal): Human-like flexibility
- Transfer learning
- Common sense
- Self-awareness?
- Consciousness?

**Super AI** (Speculation): Beyond human
- Incomprehensible solutions
- Novel insights
- Reality manipulation?

## The Creation Mirror

AI reflects creators:
- Our biases
- Our knowledge
- Our limitations
- Our aspirations

We see ourselves in what we build.
