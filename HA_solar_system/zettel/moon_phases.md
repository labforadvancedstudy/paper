# Moon Phases

## Core Insight
The Moon is humanity's first calendar - a celestial clock that counts in light and shadow, teaching us that change itself has patterns.

Watch the Moon for a month: sliver, crescent, half, gibbous, full, then back again. This cosmic breathing - inhaling light, exhaling darkness - gave humans their first sense of time beyond days. Unlike the Sun's binary presence/absence, the Moon teaches gradation, process, becoming.

Children draw the Moon as a crescent because that's when it's most obviously Moon - the full moon could be anything round, but the crescent is unmistakable lunar signature. We see the Moon's changes more clearly than we see the Moon itself. It's the sky's way of teaching us that everything waxes and wanes.
