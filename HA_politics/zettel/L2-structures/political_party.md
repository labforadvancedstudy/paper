# Political Party

## Core Insight
The organization of political will - a structured group that seeks power through electoral means, transforming diffuse preferences into focused political force.

Parties are politics' great simplifiers. In a world of infinite political positions, parties create manageable choices: us or them, left or right, change or continuity. They bundle issues, candidates, and ideologies into digestible packages.

What parties do:
- Aggregate interests (many voices → one platform)
- Recruit candidates (finding who will serve)
- Mobilize voters (turning sympathy into votes)
- Organize government (coordinating elected officials)
- Simplify choices (reducing complexity)
- Create identity (belonging to something)

The party paradox: they exist to represent people but develop their own interests - survival, power, resources. Party elites may pursue different goals than members or voters. The organization becomes an end in itself.

Party types reflect their birth:
- Cadre parties (elite networks)
- Mass parties (popular movements)
- Catch-all parties (broad coalitions)
- Cartel parties (state-funded institutions)
- Movement parties (cause-driven)
- Personal parties (leader vehicles)

In theory, parties channel democracy. In practice, they can also constrain it - limiting choices, controlling access, managing dissent. They're simultaneously democracy's vehicles and its limits.

The digital age challenges parties. When anyone can organize online, when identities fragment, when trust in institutions collapses - what role for these industrial-age organizations?
