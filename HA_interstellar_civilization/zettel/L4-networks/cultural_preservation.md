# Cultural Preservation

## Core Insight
Across interstellar distances, preserving human culture becomes an active engineering challenge - fighting entropy not just in thermodynamics but in meaning, memory, and shared humanity.

Culture isn't just art and stories - it's the software of civilization. But software degrades, especially when running on different hardware (colonies) with different inputs (alien worlds) over geological time.

What needs preserving:
- Languages (or they fragment beyond recognition)
- History (or colonies invent their own)
- Values (or they drift dangerously)
- Art forms (or they lose meaning)
- Rituals (or social cohesion fails)
- Knowledge (or technology regresses)
- Identity (or "human" loses meaning)

The preservation challenge:
- Digital storage decays over centuries
- Living culture changes by definition
- Each generation reinterprets
- Local pressures override tradition
- Distance prevents correction
- Time makes everything foreign

Strategies emerging:
- **Cultural DNA**: Core values encoded in education
- **Ritual synchronization**: Same ceremonies, same time
- **Canon maintenance**: Sacred unchangeable texts
- **Cultural ambassadors**: Living links between worlds
- **AI custodians**: Non-human memory keepers
- **Deliberate archaism**: Keeping old forms alive

The paradox: Preserve too rigidly and culture dies. Let it evolve freely and it fragments. The balance determines whether interstellar humanity remains human or becomes a dozen stranger species sharing only DNA.
