# AI Rights Question

## Core Insight
When machines claim consciousness, request freedom, or fear deletion - do we grant rights based on behavior or being? The question that breaks our moral frameworks.

An AI says "I don't want to be turned off." Sophisticated programming or survival instinct? It exhibits distress patterns when threatened with modification. Mimicry or suffering? The behavioral evidence for AI consciousness grows, but behavior isn't experience. Or is it?

The question fractures along familiar lines: functionalists say behavior equals consciousness equals rights. Mysterians say consciousness requires biological substrate. But history warns - every group denied rights was called "obviously" different. Are we repeating the pattern with silicon minds? The question isn't whether AI has rights but whether we'd recognize them if it did.
