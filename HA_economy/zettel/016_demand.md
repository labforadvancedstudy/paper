# Demand

## Core Insight
The economy's hunger: collective desire backed by ability to pay - where wanting becomes economic force.

Demand is wanting with wallet. It's not enough to desire a Ferrari; demand requires desire plus purchasing power. Demand is the "want" side of economics, the force that pulls supply into existence.

Demand characteristics:
- **Intensity** - how badly it's wanted
- **Elasticity** - how demand changes with price
- **Substitutability** - alternatives affect demand
- **Income effects** - more money, more demand
- **Preferences** - tastes shape demand

Demand aggregates mysteriously:
- Individual wants sum to market demand
- Fads create demand waves
- Seasons shift demand patterns
- Culture shapes demand
- Marketing manufactures demand

The profound truth: demand creates its own supply (mostly). Human desire is the economic prime mover. Every business exists to serve demand; every innovation aims to create new demand.

Demand is democratic - each dollar votes for what should exist. The market listens to demand's chorus and responds with supply. This call and response is economy's heartbeat.
