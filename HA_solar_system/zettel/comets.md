# Comets

## Core Insight
Dirty snowballs from the Solar System's edge become spectacular visitors - frozen time capsules that preserve primordial materials while teaching us about our origins through their spectacular deaths.

Comets are paradoxes: ancient yet ephemeral, tiny yet visible across millions of miles, dead ice that comes alive near the Sun. As they approach, solar heat sublimates ice directly to gas, creating comas larger than planets and tails stretching millions of miles. The same object that was an invisible chunk in the Oort Cloud becomes a celestial spectacle visible to naked eyes.

Each comet visit writes history. Their spectra reveal water, organic molecules, amino acids - life's building blocks. Their orbits trace the Solar System's gravitational landscape. Their deaths feed zodiacal light and meteor showers. Halley's Comet has watched human civilization rise. Shoemaker-Levy 9 showed us planetary impacts in real-time. In comets, we see our Solar System's memory made visible, ancient ice telling stories of when worlds were young.
