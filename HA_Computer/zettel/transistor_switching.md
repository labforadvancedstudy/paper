# Transistor Switching

## Core Insight
The transistor is humanity's smallest decision maker - a crystal that says yes or no billions of times per second.

A transistor is absurdly simple: voltage here controls current there. Like a faucet where electricity controls electricity. But from this simplicity emerges all computation. String millions together and they can calculate anything calculable.

Each transistor is a tiny gate. Open: electrons flow (1). Closed: they don't (0). The miracle isn't that it works - it's that we can make them so small that billions fit on a chip the size of a fingernail, switching fast enough to simulate entire universes.
