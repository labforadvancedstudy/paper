# Working

## Core Insight
The primal trade: my energy and time for resources - the original economic transaction.

Watch a child do chores for allowance. They've discovered work: the transformation of human effort into desired things. This is economics' most personal intersection - where our finite life force meets infinite wants.

Working reveals:
- **Effort has value** - sweat becomes stuff
- **Time is scarce** - working means not playing
- **Skills matter** - better work, better reward
- **Fairness questions** - is this worth it?
- **The body's limits** - exhaustion is real

The working child learns:
- Nothing is free (even gifts required someone's work)
- Different work pays differently (unfair but true)
- Working smart beats working hard
- Some work is joy, some is suffering
- Money is just frozen work

From hunting mammoth to coding apps, work is how humans transform energy into economy. The tragedy: we must spend life to live. The miracle: we can store work as wealth, trade work for dreams.

Every paycheck is just society saying "your life force has value." Economics begins when we learn to sell our time.
