# Testing Philosophy
## Core Insight
Testing isn't about finding bugs - it's about building confidence that software behaves as intended.

## The Testing Pyramid

```
        UI Tests
       /        \
    Integration Tests
   /                \
  Unit Tests
 /                    \
Static Analysis & Types
```

Foundation strong, peak minimal.

## Types of Confidence

**Correctness**: Does right thing
**Robustness**: Handles edge cases
**Performance**: Fast enough
**Security**: Safe enough
**Usability**: Friendly enough

Different tests build different confidence.

## Test-Driven Development

Write test first because:
- Clarifies requirements
- Designs better interfaces
- Ensures testability
- Documents behavior
- Enables refactoring

Not dogma. Tool for thinking.

## The Coverage Illusion

100% coverage ≠ bug-free:
- Tests can be wrong
- Requirements misunderstood
- Integration issues
- Performance problems
- User experience gaps

Coverage necessary, not sufficient.

## Testing Philosophy

**Test behavior, not implementation**
**Make tests readable as documentation**
**Fast tests run more often**
**Flaky tests erode confidence**
**Delete obsolete tests**

Good tests enable change.
Bad tests prevent it.
