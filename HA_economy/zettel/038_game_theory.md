# Game Theory

## Core Insight
Strategic chess in economic life: when your best move depends on their move - rationality in a hall of mirrors.

Game theory maps what happens when rational actors interact strategically. It's not about games but about interdependence - my outcome depends on your choice, yours on mine.

Core concepts:
- **Nash equilibrium** - no one wants to change strategy
- **Prisoner's dilemma** - individual rationality → collective stupidity
- **Zero-sum vs positive-sum** - fight for pie vs grow pie
- **Dominant strategies** - best regardless of others
- **Information sets** - who knows what when

Game theory explains:
- Why cartels collapse (cheating pays)
- Why arms races happen (not arming is dangerous)
- Why reputation matters (repeated games)
- Why cooperation emerges (tit-for-tat)
- Why threats work (or don't)

The profound insight: rational individuals often create irrational outcomes. The market's invisible hand sometimes slaps itself.

Real world is messier than theory - people aren't perfectly rational, games aren't clearly defined, payoffs aren't known. But framework illuminates why smart people do dumb things together.
