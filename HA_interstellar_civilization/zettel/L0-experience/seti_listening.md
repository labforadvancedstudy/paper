# SETI Listening

## Core Insight
SETI represents humanity's transformation from passive wonderers to active listeners - we've turned our curiosity into radio dishes pointed at the stars, hoping someone else is broadcasting.

The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence is what happens when "Are we alone?" becomes an engineering problem. Scientists sit in control rooms, watching waterfall displays of radio frequencies, looking for patterns that can't be natural.

The experience of SETI:
- Radio telescopes like giant ears
- Computer screens showing frequency analysis
- The "Wow!" signal that never repeated
- False alarms from microwave ovens
- The Drake Equation on whiteboards
- Decades of silence (so far)

What makes SETI profound isn't the technology - it's the optimism. We're essentially hoping that somewhere, somewhen, another civilization decided to shout into the void just like us. We're listening for echoes of ourselves in the cosmos.

Every day of silence makes us wonder: Are we early? Are we listening wrong? Is everyone quiet on purpose? Or is the silence itself the message?
