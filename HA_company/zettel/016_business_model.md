# Business Model

## Core Insight
A business model is the company's algorithm - the repeatable logic that transforms inputs into outputs, costs into revenues, ideas into sustainable reality.

Every company runs on code, even pre-digital ones. IF customer pays THEN deliver product. WHILE costs < revenue CONTINUE operating. The business model is this core logic, abstracted from daily chaos into repeatable pattern.

Models evolve like species. Subscription replaced purchase. Platform replaced pipeline. Freemium replaced paywall. Each evolution unlocks new possibility spaces. The model determines what's possible more than execution determines what happens.

But models aren't eternal. They're hypotheses about value creation and capture. Markets test these hypotheses ruthlessly. Models that match reality thrive. Models that don't, die. The graveyard of companies is littered with beautiful models that met ugly reality.
