# Depoliticization

## Core Insight
The strategic removal of issues from political contestation - making the contingent appear necessary, the political seem technical, the debatable feel decided.

Depoliticization is power's cleverest trick. Instead of winning political arguments, remove issues from politics entirely. What can't be debated can't be challenged.

Common depoliticization moves:
- "It's just economics" (market outcomes as natural)
- "Science says..." (political choices as technical necessities)
- "There is no alternative" (TINA - Thatcher's favorite)
- "It's human nature" (current arrangements as biological destiny)
- "The algorithm decides" (hiding politics in code)
- "It's too complex for politics" (expertise as exclusion)

The process works through:
1. **Naturalization**: Making the social appear natural
2. **Technicalization**: Turning political questions into technical ones
3. **Externalization**: Placing decisions beyond democratic reach
4. **Complexity**: Making issues too complicated for public debate
5. **Urgency**: No time for politics in crisis

But depoliticization is itself deeply political. Every "non-political" realm was politicized before being depoliticized. The economy was moral before becoming "scientific." Gender was political before becoming "natural."

The tell: whenever someone says "keep politics out of X," they're doing politics. They're trying to lock in current arrangements by placing them beyond challenge.

Depoliticization serves existing power by making change seem impossible, unnatural, or destructive. But it's always reversible. What was depoliticized can be repoliticized. The personal can become political. The technical can become democratic. The natural can become social.
