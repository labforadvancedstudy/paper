# Power Structures

## Core Insight
The invisible architecture - where cultural capital flows through hidden channels, determining who speaks, what's seen, and why certain voices dominate while others remain silenced.

Power operates through:
- Institutional positions
- Economic capital
- Cultural credentials
- Network connections
- Discourse control

Artworld hierarchies:
- Museums over galleries
- Collectors over artists
- Critics over public
- Centers over periphery
- West over rest

Gatekeeping mechanisms:
- MFA requirements
- Gallery representation
- Museum acquisition
- Critical attention
- Market validation

Exclusion strategies:
- Language barriers
- Network absence
- Capital requirements
- Geographic distance
- Cultural codes

Resistance tactics:
- Alternative spaces
- Collective organizing
- Direct action
- Counter-narratives
- System hacking

Digital disruptions:
- Gatekeepers bypassed
- Networks visible
- Capital tracked
- Influence mapped
- Power questioned

Yet power adapts:
- New elites emerge
- Platforms control
- Algorithms discriminate
- Capital concentrates
- Inclusion tokenizes

Intersections matter:
- Race × class
- Gender × geography
- Sexuality × disability
- Age × education
- Identity × access

Change requires:
- Structure recognition
- Collective action
- Resource redistribution
- Platform building
- Sustained pressure

Power in art isn't conspiracy but structure. Not individual evil but systemic function. Recognition first step to resistance.
