# Synthetic Data Generation

## Core Insight
AI creating training data for AI - a strange loop where machines teach machines using imaginary examples that somehow capture real patterns.

Real data is messy, biased, expensive, private. So we build AI to imagine data: fake faces indistinguishable from real, synthetic medical records preserving statistical properties without real patients, simulated environments for training robots. The simulated becomes more useful than the real.

This breaks fundamental assumptions about learning from experience. If AI can learn from AI-generated data, what is "experience"? If synthetic patients train better doctors than real ones, what is "real"? We're approaching recursive improvement - AI creating better data to train better AI to create even better data.
