# Intelligence: The g Factor

**Core Concept**: A general cognitive ability underlies performance across all mental tasks.

## One-Line Definition
There's a common engine powering all types of thinking - speed, memory, reasoning all correlate.

## Simple Mental Model
Like athletic ability - someone good at running is often good at jumping and swimming. Not always, but the correlation is real.

## Key Mechanism
1. Processing speed foundation
2. Working memory capacity
3. Pattern recognition ability
4. Abstract reasoning power

## Practical Example
A chess master often excels at programming, music, and math. Not because they're similar, but because the same cognitive engine drives excellence across domains.

## Common Misconception
Intelligence is many separate abilities. While specialized abilities exist, they all correlate with a general factor that explains ~50% of variance.
