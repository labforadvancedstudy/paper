# Regulation

## Core Insight
Regulation is the economy's immune system - rules that emerge to prevent the system from destroying itself through its own excesses.

Markets are powerful but blind. Left alone, they optimize for profit with the ruthless efficiency of evolution. This creates both wonders (innovation) and horrors (child labor, toxic waste, monopolies). Regulation is society saying "not everything profitable should be done."

But here's the paradox: regulations are written by humans, enforced by humans, and evaded by humans. Every rule creates incentives to find loopholes. Every protection creates costs. It's an eternal game of cat and mouse between regulators trying to prevent harm and businesses trying to maximize profit.

Good regulation is like good traffic laws - invisible when working, catastrophic when absent. We only notice financial regulation after a crash, environmental regulation after a disaster, safety regulation after deaths. The successes are invisible; the failures are headlines.

The deep challenge is that regulation must be complex enough to handle a complex economy but simple enough to be understood and enforced. Too little and markets create externalities that destroy commons. Too much and innovation dies. It's a tightrope walk over an economic volcano.
