# Translation

## Core Insight
The impossible necessary art - moving meaning across language barriers.

## The Eternal Traduttore, Traditore

"Translator, traitor" say the Italians. Every translation is betrayal because languages don't map 1:1. Japanese "木漏れ日" (komorebi) means "sunlight filtering through leaves" - no single English word exists.

Translation challenges:
- **Lexical gaps**: Words that don't exist
- **Grammar mismatch**: Turkish has witnessed/hearsay markers
- **Cultural concepts**: German "Schadenfreude"
- **Wordplay**: Puns die in translation
- **Register/tone**: Tu/vous, formal/informal
- **Poetry**: Sound and meaning intertwined

Translation types:
L1: Word-for-word (usually fails)
L2: Sense-for-sense (meaning over form)
L3: Cultural adaptation (localization)
L4: Machine translation (statistical patterns)
L5: Neural translation (AI understanding?)
L10: Direct thought transfer (no language needed?)

The paradox: Perfect translation is impossible, yet we do it constantly and it works.
