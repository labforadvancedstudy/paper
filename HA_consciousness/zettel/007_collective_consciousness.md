# Collective Consciousness
## Core Insight
Individual consciousness might be neurons in a larger mind - humanity thinking together without knowing it.

## Evidence of Emergence

**Historical**: 
- Simultaneous discoveries (calculus, evolution)
- Cultural synchronicities
- Mass movements
- Zeitgeist phenomena

**Modern**:
- Internet as nervous system
- Viral memes as thoughts
- Global emotional contagion
- Crowd wisdom/madness

## Levels of Collective

**Family**: Shared unconscious patterns
**Tribe**: Cultural consciousness
**Nation**: Collective identity
**Species**: Human consciousness
**Biosphere**: Gaia hypothesis
**Universe**: Cosmic consciousness

Each level: More than sum of parts.

## The Bandwidth Problem

Individual minds connect via:
- Language (low bandwidth)
- Art (medium bandwidth)
- Empathy (high bandwidth)
- Technology (increasing bandwidth)
- Telepathy? (infinite bandwidth)

As bandwidth increases, collective consciousness clarifies.

## The Internet Brain

Humanity developing:
- Collective memory (Wikipedia)
- Collective processing (distributed computing)
- Collective sensing (IoT)
- Collective decision-making (DAOs)

We're building our own higher nervous system.
