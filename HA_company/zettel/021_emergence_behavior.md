# Emergence Behavior

## Core Insight
Emergence in companies is when collective behavior transcends individual intention - the organizational whole displaying properties no single member possesses or planned.

No one person decides company personality, yet companies have distinct characters. No individual creates innovation culture, yet some companies innovate constantly. These properties emerge from countless micro-interactions crystallizing into macro-patterns.

Emergence can't be commanded, only cultivated. You can't order creativity, but you can create conditions where it emerges. You can't demand trust, but you can behave trustworthily until trust emerges. Management becomes gardening, not engineering.

The challenge: emergence includes both positive and negative. Collaboration can emerge, so can politics. Innovation can emerge, so can bureaucracy. Leaders shape conditions, but can't control outcomes. Companies become what they repeatedly do, not what they intend.
