# Level 2: Things Do Things
*The birth of the sentence*

> "In the beginning was the Verb." - Goethe (disagreeing with John)

## The Magic Moment

Watch a two-year-old discover sentences:

Day 1: "Ball!" (pointing)  
Day 2: "Big ball!"  
Day 3: "Doggy eat!"  
Day 4: "Doggy eat ball!"  

The universe starts happening. Not just things, but EVENTS.

## What You Learn at This Level

### The Verb Revolution

Verbs are the engines of reality. Without them, nothing happens:

**Basic Verb Types**:
1. **Action**: run, eat, throw
2. **State**: be, seem, exist  
3. **Change**: become, grow, break
4. **Mental**: think, want, know
5. **Speech**: say, ask, promise

**The Universal Sentence**

Every human language can make this structure:

**SOMEONE does SOMETHING**
- Dog runs
- Baby cries  
- Bird flies

This is SV (Subject-Verb) order. Add an object:

**SOMEONE does SOMETHING to SOMETHING**
- Dog eats bone
- Baby wants milk
- Bird catches worm

This is SVO order. English, Chinese, Swahili use this.

### Word Order Matters (Sometimes)

**English** (SVO):
- Dog bites man ≠ Man bites dog

**Japanese** (SOV):
- 犬が人を噛む (Dog [subject] man [object] bites)

**Latin** (flexible):
- Canis mordet hominem
- Hominem mordet canis  
- Mordet canis hominem
(All mean "dog bites man" - endings show who does what)

### The Grammar of Verbs

Verbs are shapeshifters:

**Tense** (When?):
- I walk (now)
- I walked (before)  
- I will walk (later)

**Aspect** (How?):
- I walk (simple)
- I am walking (ongoing)
- I have walked (completed)

**Mood** (Reality status?):
- I walk (fact)
- I might walk (possibility)
- Walk! (command)
- I would walk (hypothetical)

**Agreement** (Who?):
- I walk, you walk, she walks
- Spanish: camino, caminas, camina
- Chinese: 我走, 你走, 他走 (no change!)

## Practice Exercises

1. **Two-Word Stories**: Write 10 sentences with just subject + verb. "Dog runs. Sun shines. Baby laughs." Feel the complete thought.

2. **Verb Tense Journey**: Take one verb (eat). Write it in:
   - Past: ate
   - Present: eat/eats
   - Future: will eat
   - Present continuous: is eating
   - Past perfect: had eaten

3. **Word Order Play**: Write "Cat catches mouse" in different orders:
   - Catches cat mouse
   - Mouse cat catches
   - Cat mouse catches
   Which sound like English? Which don't? Why?

4. **Verb or Not?**: Which are verbs?
   - run, running, runner
   - happy, happiness, happen
   - quick, quickly, quicken

5. **Mini-Conversations**: Using only 2-3 word sentences:
   - "Dog hungry?" "Dog ate." "Dog happy!"

## The Power of Combination

Subject + Verb creates infinite possibilities:

**With 10 nouns and 10 verbs**:
- 10 × 10 = 100 simple sentences

**Add objects**:
- 10 × 10 × 10 = 1,000 sentences

**Add adjectives/adverbs**:
- Explosion of meaning

This is the "discrete infinity" of language - finite parts, infinite expressions.

## Universal vs. Particular

**All languages share**:
- Subjects and predicates
- Ways to mark time
- Commands vs. statements
- Questions vs. answers

**Languages differ in**:
- Word order
- How much the verb changes
- What must be marked (gender? number? respect?)
- What can be left unsaid

## The Philosophical Depth

When a child says "Doggy run," they're claiming:
- Events exist
- Actors cause actions
- Time can be divided
- Language mirrors reality

This is huge. They're encoding the structure of experience.

## Common Beginner Mistakes

1. **Wrong word order**: "Eat I pizza" (if English isn't SOV)

2. **Missing agreement**: "She walk" (forgetting -s)

3. **Tense confusion**: "I go yesterday" (wrong tense)

4. **Overgeneralizing**: "I goed" (regular rule on irregular verb)

5. **Direct translation**: "I have 20 years" (from "J'ai 20 ans")

## Cultural Wisdom

**Pirahã** (Amazon): May lack recursion - can't say "John said that Mary thinks that..."

**Mandarin**: No tense marking on verbs - context shows time

**Russian**: Different verbs for going by foot vs. vehicle

**Arabic**: Verbs change for gender of subject

**Navajo**: Incredibly complex verb system encoding manner, direction, more

## Key Takeaways

1. **Verbs make things happen** - without them, language is static
2. **Word order carries meaning** - but not in all languages
3. **Verbs are shapeshifters** - changing for time, mood, person
4. **SVO is common but not universal** - SOV is actually more common
5. **Two words can make a complete thought** - subject + verb = sentence

## What's Next

You can name things (nouns).  
You can make things happen (verbs).  
You can create simple sentences.

But language wants to be more complex. Patterns want to emerge. Rules want to crystallize.

Time for real grammar.
