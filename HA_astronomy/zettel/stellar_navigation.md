# Stellar Navigation

## Core Insight
Before GPS, humans crossed oceans guided by stars - turning the night sky into a map and clock that worked anywhere on Earth, requiring only eyes, memory, and simple tools.

Polaris, the North Star, gives latitude directly - its altitude equals your latitude in the Northern Hemisphere. No Southern Hemisphere equivalent exists, so navigators used the Southern Cross and pointer stars. Longitude required accurate time. Earth rotates 15 degrees per hour, so comparing local noon to reference time gives east-west position. The marine chronometer, perfected in the 1760s, finally solved the longitude problem.

Polynesian navigators achieved more with less. They memorized rising and setting positions of stars throughout the year, creating a "star compass." They read ocean swells, cloud reflections from islands, and bird flight patterns. Arab navigators used the kamal, measuring star altitudes with a wooden board. Vikings possibly used crystal "sunstones" to find the Sun through clouds. These techniques guided humanity across unknown oceans. The sky was humanity's first GPS, requiring no satellites - just knowledge passed through generations.
