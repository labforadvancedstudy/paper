# Death as 3D Problem
## Core Insight
Death only appears final from a 3D perspective; in higher dimensions, your entire existence is a static object without beginning or end.

## Dimensional Limitations

**3D Experience**: Birth → Life → Death (linear time)
**4D Reality**: Your entire life exists as a static "time-worm"
**5D+**: All possible versions of you exist simultaneously

Like how a 2D being sees a sphere as appearing/disappearing circles, we see life as appearing/disappearing consciousness.

## Consciousness Continuity

"But when I die, consciousness stops!"

Does it? Every night in deep sleep, consciousness "stops." Yet "you" wake up. How do you know it's the same you?

Consciousness is like a river:
- Water molecules constantly change
- The river remains
- "You" are a pattern, not the substrate

## The N-Dimensional View

From dimension N, all possible yous exist:
- You who drank coffee
- You who drank tea
- You who was never born
- You who already died
- You who wrote this

Death = consciousness moving between 3D slices.
