# Thermodynamics of Life

## Core Insight
Life is a way for the universe to increase entropy faster - we exist because we're excellent at spreading out energy.

This seems backwards. Life looks like it decreases entropy - creating order, building complexity, organizing matter. A human body is far more ordered than the chemicals it's made from. Haven't we beaten the second law of thermodynamics?

No. We've mastered it. Life doesn't violate thermodynamics - it surfs it. Yes, you decrease entropy locally (inside your body), but you increase it globally (in your environment) even faster. You're an entropy pump, taking in concentrated energy (food) and spreading it out as heat.

The genius: life found a loophole. The second law says total entropy must increase, but it doesn't say it has to increase uniformly. By creating local pockets of order, life can actually accelerate the universal trend toward disorder. We're helping the universe die more efficiently.

This explains why life emerges anywhere there's an energy gradient: deep-sea vents, sunlit surfaces, chemical disequilibria. Life is what happens when the universe finds a faster route from order to chaos. We're not fighting thermodynamics - we're its most sophisticated expression.
