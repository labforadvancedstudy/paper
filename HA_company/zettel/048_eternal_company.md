# Eternal Company

## Core Insight
Companies approach immortality through institutional transcendence - potentially becoming permanent features of human civilization, outliving their creators by centuries.

Some companies already span centuries. Lloyd's of London: 300+ years. Kongo Gumi construction: 1,400 years before acquisition. These entities transcend human timescales, becoming geological facts of civilization. Can companies achieve true immortality?

The requirements for eternal companies: adaptability (survive environment changes), purpose (reason to continue), renewal (fresh energy each generation), embedding (become infrastructure). Most critically: relevance across eras. Eternal companies solve eternal problems.

But perhaps eternal companies already exist in distributed form. "Banking" is immortal, though individual banks die. "Markets" persist through incarnations. The company form itself might be immortal - an organizational pattern that recreates itself through infinite instances.
