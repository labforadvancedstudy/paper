# Play

## Core Insight
The laboratory where young humans safely experiment with social rules, roles, and relationships.

Play looks frivolous but is deadly serious. When children play house, they're modeling society. When they play tag, they're learning rules, fairness, and consequences. Play is society's flight simulator.

"Let's pretend" might be humanity's most important words. In play, a stick becomes a sword, a box becomes a castle, and children become adults. They practice power ("I'm the king!"), negotiation ("No fair!"), and recovery from failure (getting tagged is temporary).

Even adult play - sports, games, hobbies - maintains this function: safe spaces to compete, cooperate, and experiment with different selves.
