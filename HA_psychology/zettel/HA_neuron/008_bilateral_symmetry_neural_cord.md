# 008_bilateral_symmetry_neural_cord

## The Axis of Awareness

With bilateral symmetry comes a revolution:
a front and back, left and right,
and most crucially - a central nerve cord.

### The Directional Imperative
- Moving forward requires different computation than sideways
- Sensors concentrate at the leading edge
- Processing follows sensory density
- The birth of cephalization

### From Net to Cord
The transformation:
- Neurons cluster along the midline
- Faster signal propagation
- Hierarchical processing emerges
- The first "information highways"

### Computational Advantages
- Compare left vs right inputs
- Integrate along body length
- Coordinate complex movements
- Enable true navigation

### The Precedent for Consciousness
In the nerve cord, we see:
- Centralized integration
- Serial processing
- The scaffold for future brains
