# Drawing

## Core Insight
The primordial mark-making impulse - hand translating eye through line, where seeing becomes touching becomes knowing.

Drawing is thinking made visible. The hand discovers what the mind hasn't yet articulated. Line by line, understanding emerges:
- Contour drawing: edge-finding, boundary-mapping
- Gesture drawing: capturing energy, not appearance
- Structural drawing: revealing hidden architecture
- Tonal drawing: sculpting with light and shadow
- Blind drawing: trusting hand-eye connection

Drawing requires unlearning. Children draw fearlessly. Adults must rediscover that direct translation from perception to mark. The intervening symbols - "this is how trees look" - must dissolve.

Materials shape thinking:
- Pencil: control, revision, gradation
- Charcoal: bold, immediate, atmospheric
- Ink: commitment, no erasure, confidence
- Digital stylus: infinite undo paradox

Life drawing remains foundation. Not for anatomy knowledge but for seeing practice. Every body different. Every pose new problem. Eye learns to measure relationships, not memorize formulas.

But drawing transcends representation. Cy Twombly's scribbles. Sol LeWitt's instructions. Drawing as idea, process, trace of thought moving through time. The mark itself becomes content.

Contemporary drawing exploded boundaries. Wall-sized works. Performative drawing. Collaborative drawing. Digital/physical hybrids. Yet essence remains: mind to hand to surface, the most direct art.
