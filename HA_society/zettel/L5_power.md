# Power

## Core Insight
The ability to make others do what they wouldn't otherwise do - the force that bends individual will to collective patterns.

Power isn't just domination. It's a teacher shaping minds, a celebrity influencing fashion, a baby crying until fed. Power flows through every relationship, sometimes obvious (police), sometimes subtle (the friend who always picks the restaurant).

Foucault revealed power's pervasiveness: it's not held but exercised, not possessed but performed. Modern power doesn't oppress; it produces - citizens who monitor themselves, workers who internalize productivity, students who compete for grades.

The deepest power is invisible. When people want what power wants them to want, no force is needed. Advertising, education, and culture shape desires more effectively than armies shape behavior.
