# Corporate Lifecycle

## Core Insight
Companies, like organisms, follow predictable lifecycles - from entrepreneurial birth through growth to maturity, then either renewal or decline, each stage bringing distinct challenges.

Birth: Founder energy drives everything. Flexibility maximum, resources minimum. Growth: Systems replace chaos. Scaling becomes priority. Maturity: Efficiency optimized, innovation struggles. Decline: Rigidity increases, relevance decreases. Renewal: Transformation or death.

Each stage demands different leadership. Entrepreneurs birth companies but rarely scale them. Operators scale companies but rarely transform them. Transformers renew companies but need burning platforms. The rare leaders who span stages adapt their style to lifecycle needs.

Unlike biological organisms, companies can reset their lifecycle. IBM transformed from hardware to services. Microsoft from desktop to cloud. Apple from computers to lifestyle. But renewal requires killing parts of what you were to become what you must be.
