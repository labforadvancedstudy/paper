# Art About Art

## Core Insight
The mirror facing itself - where art takes its own processes, history, and condition as subject, creating infinite recursive loops of self-examination.

Meta-art strategies multiply:
- Art historical quotation
- Process documentation
- Institutional critique
- Medium reflexivity
- Market commentary

Historical self-awareness:
- Velázquez's Las Meninas
- Manet's Olympia
- Duchamp's Fountain
- Rauschenberg's Erased de Kooning
- Koons's vacuum cleaners

Why art examines itself:
- Question assumptions
- Reveal hidden structures
- Challenge power dynamics
- Explore formal limits
- Demystify creation

Contemporary meta-forms:
- Artists' artists
- Curator exhibitions
- Museum interventions
- Art fair art
- Instagram about Instagram

Self-reference risks:
- Insider discourse
- Navel-gazing
- Elitism reinforced
- Public alienation
- Meaning loops

Yet value emerges:
- Systems exposed
- Assumptions questioned
- History activated
- Power visible
- Alternatives imagined

Digital amplifies recursion:
- Screenshots of screenshots
- Memes about memes
- AI training on art
- NFTs of NFTs
- Meta-metaverse

Key insight: Art that questions art keeps art alive. Self-examination prevents ossification. The moment art stops questioning itself, it dies. Meta-art is immune system.
