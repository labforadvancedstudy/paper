# Mental Models

## Core Insight
We don't experience reality - we experience our brain's simulation of reality.

Your brain runs constant physics simulations: where will the ball land? Will that branch hold? These models let you catch, throw, and navigate without calculating trajectories. But models simplify by necessity. The map isn't the territory. Experts have richer models - a chef sees flavor combinations where you see ingredients. Paradigm shifts happen when models break: the sun doesn't rise, Earth spins.
