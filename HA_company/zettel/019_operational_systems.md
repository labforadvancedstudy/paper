# Operational Systems

## Core Insight
Operational systems are the company's muscle memory - encoded procedures that transform intention into consistent action without conscious thought.

Systems make the complex simple through repetition. Order processing, inventory management, quality control - each system captures learned patterns and makes them executable by anyone. Knowledge crystallizes into process.

Good systems are invisible - they work so smoothly no one notices. Bad systems create friction, workarounds, shadow processes. Great systems improve themselves, incorporating feedback, evolving with need. They're living documents, not dead rules.

Systems enable scale. What one expert knows becomes what hundreds can do. But systems also constrain. They optimize for the common case, struggle with exceptions. The art is building systems flexible enough to handle variety, rigid enough to ensure quality.
