# Sentence

## Core Insight
The complete thought - subject + predicate creating meaning greater than parts.

## The Magic Formula

Every human language can make sentences. The universal pattern:

SOMEONE does SOMETHING (to SOMEONE/SOMETHING)

Basic patterns across languages:
- SVO: English, Chinese (我爱你)
- SOV: Japanese, Korean (私はあなたを愛する)
- VSO: Arabic, Irish
- VOS: Malagasy
- OSV: Rare (Yoda speak)
- OVS: Very rare

The miracle: finite rules generate infinite sentences. You've never heard this exact sentence before, yet you understand it.

L1: One word ("Run!")
L2: Two words ("Dog run")
L3: Simple sentences ("The dog runs")
L5: Complex sentences (embedding)
L7: Meta-sentences ("This sentence is false")
