# Europa Ocean

## Core Insight
Beneath Europa's icy shell lies more water than all Earth's oceans - a dark, possibly living sea heated by Jupiter's tidal forces, making this moon our best bet for finding alien life.

Europa defies expectations. Smaller than our Moon, it should be frozen solid. But Jupiter's massive gravity kneads Europa like dough, generating heat through tidal flexing. This heat melts ice from below, creating a global ocean beneath a kilometers-thick ice shell. The ocean has existed for billions of years, contains salts leached from rocks, and might have hydrothermal vents on its floor.

On Earth, wherever we find water, we find life. Europa has water, heat, chemistry, and time - all ingredients for life. Dark streaks on its surface might be ocean material welling up through cracks. Plumes might spray ocean water into space, offering tastes of an alien sea. In Europa, we see that habitable worlds might be common, just hidden beneath ice rather than basking in starlight. The Solar System's life might be swimming in darkness.
