# Economic Entropy

## Core Insight
Economics has its own entropy - systems tend toward disorder, wealth concentrates then disperses, organizations grow then decay, all economic energy eventually dissipates into heat.

The second law of thermodynamics applies to economics. Every transaction has friction (transaction costs). Every organization fights entropy (bureaucracy). Every fortune eventually dissipates (three generations). Order requires constant energy input; without it, everything decays.

Consider corporate entropy. Young startups are highly ordered - everyone knows everyone, communication is instant, purpose is clear. As they grow, entropy increases - silos form, purposes multiply, energy dissipates into politics. Eventually, they're spending more energy maintaining structure than creating value.

Wealth follows entropic patterns. Great fortunes concentrate through skill or luck, then entropy attacks. Heirs divide estates. Managers extract rents. Competition erodes advantages. Taxes redistribute. Time defeats all accumulation. The Medici fortune is gone. Rockefeller's is dispersed. Today's billionaires will be tomorrow's footnotes.

But economics fights entropy through information. Markets create order from chaos. Prices coordinate without coordinators. Innovation resets the entropy clock. Each new technology is a local reversal of entropy, creating temporary order before succumbing to the universal trend.

The economic question becomes: how do we create pockets of negative entropy (growth, innovation, organization) while accepting the universal trend toward disorder? How do we dance with entropy rather than deny it?
