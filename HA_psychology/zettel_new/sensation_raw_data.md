# Sensation Raw Data

## Core Insight
Sensation is the universe touching consciousness - raw data streams before meaning.

Before there is "red" or "loud" or "painful", there are just electrical patterns in neurons. Sensation is the interface where physics becomes psychology - photons become vision, pressure waves become sound, molecular shapes become smell. It's data without interpretation, the pure "what" before the "why."

The magic isn't that we sense - even bacteria do that. The magic is that these raw data streams somehow become a world.
