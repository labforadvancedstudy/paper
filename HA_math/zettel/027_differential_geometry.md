# Differential Geometry - Calculus on Curved Spaces

## Core Insight
Differential geometry marries calculus with geometry - studying spaces smooth enough for derivatives but curved enough to be interesting.

## Content
Euclidean geometry assumes flat space. Differential geometry asks: what if space curves? How do we do calculus on a sphere, a torus, or spacetime itself?

Core concepts emerge:
- Tangent spaces: linearization at each point
- Vector fields: smooth assignment of vectors
- Differential forms: things to integrate
- Connections: how to parallel transport

Curvature becomes precise:
- Gaussian curvature: intrinsic bending
- Mean curvature: extrinsic bending
- Riemann tensor: complete curvature data
- Sectional curvature: 2D slices

The tools are powerful:
- Covariant derivative: differentiation on manifolds
- Lie derivative: change along flows
- Exterior derivative: generalized gradient
- Integration: Stokes' theorem unifies all

Classic results:
- Gauss-Bonnet: curvature determines topology
- Nash embedding: abstract manifolds embed in ℝⁿ
- Uniformization: surfaces have standard geometries
- Index theorems: analysis meets topology

Applications profound:
- General relativity: gravity is curvature
- Gauge theory: physics is connection
- Computer graphics: surface modeling
- Machine learning: manifold learning

Differential geometry revealed that calculus transcends flat space - it works wherever smoothness lives.
