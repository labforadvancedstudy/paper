# Emergence in Chemistry

## Core Insight
Complex chemical behaviors emerge from simple quantum rules - life, consciousness, and civilization arise from electron interactions.

Wetness isn't in a single water molecule. It emerges from hydrogen bonding networks. Similarly, no single biomolecule is alive, but together they create self-replicating, evolving systems. Chemistry builds complexity hierarchically.

Phase transitions exemplify emergence. Heat water gradually - nothing, nothing, then suddenly steam. The collective behavior shifts discontinuously though individual molecules change continuously. Order parameters capture these transitions.

Autocatalytic networks, oscillating reactions, self-assembly - chemistry spontaneously generates complexity. The Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction creates spirals and waves from simple ingredients. Life itself may be chemistry discovering self-replication through random exploration.
