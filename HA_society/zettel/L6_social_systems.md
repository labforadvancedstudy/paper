# Social Systems

## Core Insight
Society as a self-organizing, self-maintaining organism where the whole shapes the parts that shape the whole.

Systems theory reveals society isn't people plus rules plus institutions. It's an emergent entity with its own logic, maintaining itself through feedback loops. Education systems produce workers economic systems need. Economic systems create inequalities political systems manage. Political systems require educated citizens education systems produce.

The cybernetic insight: systems seek equilibrium. Deviance triggers correction mechanisms. Protests lead to reforms that preserve the system by changing it slightly. Revolution just replaces one system with another that serves similar functions differently.

No one designed these systems, yet they show design-like properties: adaptation, self-repair, reproduction. Capitalism spreads like DNA. Democracy mutates but maintains core functions. Systems evolve.
