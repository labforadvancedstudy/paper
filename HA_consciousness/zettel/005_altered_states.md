# Altered States of Consciousness
## Core Insight
Normal waking consciousness is just one configuration - consciousness has many possible states, each revealing different aspects of reality.

## The Spectrum

**Ordinary States**:
- Waking (default mode)
- Dreaming (narrative generation)
- Deep sleep (consciousness without content)
- Hypnagogic (threshold states)

**Non-Ordinary States**:
- Meditation (expanded awareness)
- Psychedelics (dissolved boundaries)
- Near-death (life review)
- Flow states (self-dissolution)
- Mystical (unity experience)

## What Changes

**Perception**: Colors brighter, patterns visible
**Time**: Dilation, compression, or dissolution
**Self**: Boundaries expand or disappear
**Meaning**: Everything significant or nothing matters
**Connection**: Separation dissolves

## Why They Matter

Each state:
- Reveals consciousness flexibility
- Shows ordinary state isn't privileged
- Provides data about consciousness nature
- Offers therapeutic potential
- Suggests reality is state-dependent

## The Integration Challenge

Going there: Easy (meditation, substances, crisis)
Staying there: Impossible (state-dependent)
Bringing back: The real work

Wisdom = integrating insights into ordinary state.
