# Cosmic Inflation

## Core Insight
The universe underwent faster-than-light expansion in its first 10^-32 seconds - inflation theory explains why space looks uniform, flat, and lacks magnetic monopoles, solving cosmology's deepest puzzles.

The standard Big Bang model had problems. Why is the universe so uniform when regions couldn't have communicated? Why is space geometrically flat to incredible precision? Where are the magnetic monopoles particle physics predicts? Alan Guth proposed inflation in 1980: a period of exponential expansion driven by a scalar field's potential energy.

In 10^-32 seconds, a subatomic patch inflated by factor 10^26 or more - like a proton expanding to solar system size. This solved everything. Inflation made the universe uniform by expanding one causally connected region. It flattened space like inflating a balloon removes wrinkles. It diluted monopoles to unobservable densities. Quantum fluctuations during inflation, stretched to cosmic scales, seeded all structure. The CMB's tiny temperature variations match inflation's predictions precisely. Inflation transformed cosmology from philosophy to precision science. The universe's largest features originated from quantum fuzz smaller than atoms.
