# Profit Mechanism

## Core Insight
Profit is the company's metabolism - the difference between energy consumed and energy expended, enabling survival, growth, and purpose beyond survival.

Revenue minus costs equals profit. Simple math, complex reality. Profit isn't greed crystallized but sustainability quantified. Without profit, companies die. With it, they can invest, expand, experiment, exist.

The mechanism runs deeper than money. Profit is stored potential, accumulated power, future compressed into present resources. It's what allows companies to weather storms, seize opportunities, serve purposes beyond immediate exchange.

But profit is means, not end. Like body fat - necessary for survival but not the purpose of eating. Companies that exist only for profit are like people who eat only to gain weight. The healthiest companies use profit to fuel purpose.
