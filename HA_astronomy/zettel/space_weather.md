# Space Weather

## Core Insight
The Sun doesn't just shine - it storms, sending magnetic eruptions that create auroras, disrupt satellites, and remind us that Earth orbits inside a star's turbulent atmosphere.

Space weather begins on the Sun. Magnetic field lines twist and reconnect, explosively releasing energy. Solar flares blast X-rays and particles. Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) hurl billions of tons of magnetized plasma into space. When these hit Earth, our magnetosphere rings like a bell. Particles funnel to poles, creating auroras. Intense storms induce currents in power grids - the 1989 Quebec blackout affected millions.

Satellites face radiation damage, orbit changes from atmospheric drag, and charging effects. Astronauts seek shelter during events. Airlines reroute polar flights. GPS accuracy degrades. We've become dependent on space technology just as we're learning how vulnerable it is. Space weather forecasting combines solar observations, interplanetary monitoring, and magnetosphere models. Like terrestrial weather, it's probabilistic - we can warn of incoming storms but can't prevent them. As solar cycle 25 intensifies, our technological civilization faces increasing space weather risks.
