# Deep Time

## Core Insight
The Solar System's 4.5-billion-year history is barely comprehensible to minds that measure in decades - yet understanding deep time reveals our cosmic moment as both ancient and infantile.

Compress Solar System history into one year. Earth forms in February, life appears in March, complex cells wait until November, dinosaurs rule December's middle weeks, humans appear at 11:59 PM on December 31st. Our entire recorded history occupies the last few seconds. This perspective shift changes everything. Mountains are temporary wrinkles. Continents drift like rafts. The Solar System itself is middle-aged, with billions of years ahead.

But zoom out further. The universe is 13.8 billion years old - our Solar System missed two-thirds of cosmic history. We're latecomers, formed from recycled star stuff, existing in the brief window when stars shine and planets can be warm. In deep time, our "permanent" Solar System is a temporary arrangement of matter and energy, significant only because it happened to produce minds capable of comprehending their own temporality.
