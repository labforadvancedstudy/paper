# Personality Illusion

## Core Insight
Personality is just statistical behavior - we mistake consistency for essence.

You're not introverted; you just choose solitude more often than others. Not creative; just generate novel combinations above average. We reify patterns into things: "I have anxiety" instead of "I experience anxious moments frequently." But context changes everything. The shy person becomes bold online. The leader follows at home. Personality is weather, not climate - patterns that feel permanent but shift with conditions.
