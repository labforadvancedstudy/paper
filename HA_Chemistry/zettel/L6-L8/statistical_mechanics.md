# Statistical Mechanics in Chemistry

## Core Insight
Macroscopic properties emerge from microscopic statistics - temperature is molecular speed distribution, pressure is collision frequency, chemistry is probability.

A mole contains 10²³ molecules. We can't track individual trajectories, but statistics saves us. Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes molecular speeds. Most probable speed, average speed, RMS speed - all different, all predictable from temperature alone.

Reaction rates emerge from collision statistics. Not every collision reacts - need right energy, right orientation. Arrhenius equation captures this: rate depends exponentially on temperature because the high-energy tail of the distribution grows rapidly.

Entropy makes sense statistically. More ways to arrange disorder than order. Mix two gases, they won't unmix - not impossible, just improbable to the point of impossibility. The second law is statistics writ large.
