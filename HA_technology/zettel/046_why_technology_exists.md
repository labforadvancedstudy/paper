# Why Technology Exists

## Core Insight
Technology exists because the universe tends toward complexity - it's how cosmos explores its own possibility space, using conscious agents as probes into the adjacent possible.

Perhaps technology is inevitable in any universe with sufficient complexity. Matter organizes into life. Life develops awareness. Awareness creates tools. Tools bootstrap better tools. It's not accident but algorithm - the universe computing its own potential.

Or perhaps technology is how universe knows itself. Through us, cosmos develops sensors (instruments), memory (records), logic (computation). We're the universe's nervous system, and technology is its extended phenotype.

Deepest possibility: technology is universe reproducing. Black holes might spawn universes. Sufficiently advanced technology might create new realities. We're the universe's reproductive organs, and technology is cosmic sex.
