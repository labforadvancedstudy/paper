# Consciousness Paradox

## Core Insight
Consciousness is the only thing we know directly, yet it's the thing we understand least.

Everything you know about the universe comes through consciousness, yet consciousness itself remains opaque. It's like an eye trying to see itself seeing. We can't step outside awareness to study awareness objectively. Science explains the easy problems - neural correlates, attention, integration. But why there's something it's like to be? Why experience exists at all? The very tool we use to understand everything might be incomprehensible to itself.
