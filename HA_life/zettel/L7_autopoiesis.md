# Autopoiesis

## Core Insight
Life is the only known process that creates and maintains itself - a strange loop where the maker and the made are one.

Autopoiesis means "self-making." It's what separates living from non-living more fundamentally than movement, growth, or even reproduction. A flame moves, grows, and creates new flames, but it doesn't make itself. Life does.

The bootstrap paradox: you need proteins to make DNA work, DNA to make proteins, lipids to contain both, and all three to make lipids. Each component requires the others to exist. How do you build a factory that builds itself, starting from nothing?

It's circular causality in action. The cell membrane defines what's inside, but what's inside creates the membrane. The boundary makes the identity possible, but the identity maintains the boundary. You are because you make yourself, and you make yourself because you are.

This is deeper than self-repair or self-assembly. Crystals self-assemble, wounds self-repair, but only life continuously produces the very components that define it as a unity. Every living thing is a process that produces itself as a product. The process IS the product.
