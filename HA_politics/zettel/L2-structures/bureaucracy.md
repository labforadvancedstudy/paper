# Bureaucracy

## Core Insight
The machinery of implementation - the vast apparatus of rules, roles, and routines that transforms political decisions into social reality through standardized procedures and hierarchical organization.

Bureaucracy is politics' unsexy necessity. Politicians make grand pronouncements; bureaucrats make them real. Or don't. The gap between policy and implementation is where bureaucracy lives.

Weber identified bureaucracy's ideal features:
- Hierarchy (clear chain of command)
- Specialization (division of labor)
- Rules (standardized procedures)
- Impersonality (decisions not personal)
- Merit (competence not connections)
- Records (everything documented)

But ideal bureaucracy never exists. Real bureaucracy is:
- Rule-worship (process over purpose)
- Inertia (resistance to change)
- Empire-building (growth for growth's sake)
- Red tape (procedures proliferating)
- Facelessness (no one responsible)

The bureaucratic paradox: we hate bureaucracy but need it. Without bureaucrats, no taxes collected, no benefits distributed, no regulations enforced. Modern life depends on millions following procedures.

Bureaucracy's hidden politics:
- Who gets hired shapes what gets done
- Procedures embed values
- Discretion hides power
- Delay is denial
- Complexity excludes

The deeper truth: bureaucracy IS governance. Politicians are temporary; bureaucrats endure. Real power often lies not with elected officials but with those who know how the system actually works.
