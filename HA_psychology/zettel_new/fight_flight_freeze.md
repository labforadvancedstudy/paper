# Fight, Flight, or Freeze Response

The body's ancient emergency system that hijacks rational thought when facing perceived threats, preparing us for combat, escape, or playing dead.

## The Cascade
1. Amygdala detects threat
2. Hypothalamus triggers hormones
3. Adrenaline and cortisol flood system
4. Body mobilizes resources
5. Prefrontal cortex goes offline

## Physical Changes
- Heart rate skyrockets
- Breathing becomes shallow
- Muscles tense for action
- Digestion stops
- Pupils dilate
- Pain sensitivity decreases

## Modern Mismatch
Evolved for: Tigers and territorial disputes
Activated by: Emails and traffic jams

This mismatch creates chronic stress as our bodies react to psychological threats as if they were physical predators.
