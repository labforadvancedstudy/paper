# Neutrino Astronomy

## Core Insight
Neutrinos - ghostly particles that barely interact with matter - carry information from stellar cores and cosmic accelerators, giving us X-ray vision into processes photons can never reveal.

Trillions of neutrinos pass through your body each second, mostly from the Sun. These nearly massless particles interact so weakly that a light-year of lead would only stop half. This makes them terrible to detect but perfect messengers - they escape dense stellar cores and travel unimpeded across the universe.

Detecting them requires enormous detectors. Super-Kamiokande uses 50,000 tons of pure water watched by photomultipliers, catching occasional neutrino interactions. IceCube embeds detectors in a cubic kilometer of Antarctic ice. The payoff is unique information. Solar neutrinos revealed fusion processes in the Sun's core. Supernova 1987A's neutrino burst arrived hours before light, confirming core collapse theory. High-energy neutrinos from blazars probe cosmic particle acceleration. Neutrino astronomy sees through everything - stellar interiors, dense gas clouds, the entire universe. We built underground lakes and instrumented glaciers to catch ghost particles carrying secrets light cannot tell.
