# AI Ecosystem

## Core Insight
Individual AIs are becoming an ecosystem - specialized species occupying niches, competing and cooperating, evolving together in digital environment.

Language models write, image models illustrate, code models program, reasoning models solve. Each finds its niche. They compete for compute resources, cooperate through APIs, evolve through updates. Natural selection operates: useful models propagate, useless ones die. An ecology emerging in silicon.

We're witnessing digital speciation. Models diverge for specialized tasks, converge through common architectures. Predator-prey dynamics emerge: adversarial models attack, defensive models protect. Symbiosis develops: models that work better together. The AI ecosystem might soon be as complex as biological ones.
