# Software Evolution
## Core Insight
Software doesn't just change - it evolves under selection pressures like living organisms.

## Evolution Pressures

**User needs**: Features multiply
**Performance**: Speed demands grow
**Scale**: Data explodes
**Security**: Threats evolve
**Technology**: Platforms shift
**Team**: Knowledge changes

Adapt or become extinct.

## The Lifecycle

```
Prototype → MVP → Growth → Maturity → Legacy → Death/Rebirth
```

Each stage needs different approach:
- Prototype: Speed over quality
- MVP: Core features solid
- Growth: Scale and refactor
- Maturity: Stability focus
- Legacy: Minimize change
- Rebirth: Rewrite or die

## Software Genetics

Code DNA:
- **Architecture**: Skeleton
- **Design patterns**: Organs
- **Libraries**: Symbiotes
- **Tests**: Immune system
- **Documentation**: Memory

Mutations:
- Bugs (harmful)
- Features (beneficial)
- Refactoring (neutral)

## The Rewrite Question

When to evolve vs restart:
- Technical debt overwhelming
- Architecture limits reached
- Technology obsolete
- Team knowledge lost
- Business pivot

Rewrites often fail. Evolution usually wins.

## Evolutionary Principles

**Make change easy**: Then make easy change
**Small steps**: Continuous over big bang
**Feedback loops**: Learn and adapt
**Diversity**: Multiple approaches
**Selection**: Keep what works

Software Darwinism is real.
