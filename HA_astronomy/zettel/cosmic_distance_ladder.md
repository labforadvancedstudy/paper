# Cosmic Distance Ladder

## Core Insight
Unable to measure cosmic distances directly, astronomers built an ingenious chain of methods, each calibrated by the previous - a ladder reaching from Earth to the edge of the observable universe.

The cosmic distance ladder is humanity's most ambitious measurement project. Starting with radar ranging to planets (direct measurement), we bootstrap our way to the cosmos's edge. Each "rung" works at different scales: parallax for nearby stars (up to ~100 parsecs), main-sequence fitting for star clusters (~10 kiloparsecs), Cepheid variables for nearby galaxies (~30 megaparsecs), Type Ia supernovae for distant galaxies (billions of parsecs).

Each method calibrates the next. We know Cepheids' period-luminosity relation because we measured distances to nearby ones via parallax. We calibrate supernovae using galaxies with known Cepheid distances. But errors compound - a 10% error in parallax becomes 10% error in everything built upon it. The ladder is only as strong as its lowest rung. Yet through careful cross-checking and multiple methods, we've mapped a universe 93 billion light-years across, all from Earth's surface.
