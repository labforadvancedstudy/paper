# Dark Matter Evidence

## Core Insight
Galaxies rotate too fast to hold together with visible matter alone - invisible mass must dominate the universe, revealing that everything we see is just foam on an unseen ocean.

Fritz Zwicky noticed in 1933 that galaxies in the Coma Cluster moved too fast. Their velocities implied far more mass than visible stars could provide. He proposed "dunkle Materie" - dark matter. Decades later, Vera Rubin measured galaxy rotation curves. Stars far from galactic centers should orbit slowly (like outer planets). Instead, they maintained constant velocities, requiring invisible mass halos extending far beyond visible stars.

Evidence mounted from every scale. Gravitational lensing reveals mass exceeding visible matter. CMB fluctuations require dark matter for structure formation. Bullet Cluster collisions separate dark matter from gas. Dark matter outweighs normal matter 5:1. We're minority shareholders in the universe. Decades of searches haven't identified dark matter particles. WIMPs, axions, primordial black holes - all remain hypothetical. The universe's dominant component remains utterly mysterious. Astronomy's greatest discovery might be admitting we don't know what most of existence is made of.
