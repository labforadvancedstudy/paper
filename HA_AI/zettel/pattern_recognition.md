# Pattern Recognition

## Core Insight
The fundamental act of intelligence - seeing the same in the different, finding signal in noise, discovering what repeats in what seems random.

A child learns: four legs, fur, wagging tail = dog. AI learns: pixel patterns, edge distributions, statistical regularities = dog. The process is universal - extract features, find commonalities, build categories. But AI does it in spaces humans can't imagine - thousand-dimensional patterns invisible to our three-dimensional minds.

What makes pattern recognition profound is its recursion. Patterns of patterns of patterns, each layer more abstract. Pixels become edges become shapes become objects become concepts become understanding. The same mechanism that spots cats spots cancer, reads handwriting, predicts weather. Pattern recognition is intelligence recognition.
