# Religion Formation

## Core Insight
Religion is humanity's first augmented reality - overlaying invisible meaning onto the visible world.

Why do humans everywhere invent gods? Because we're pattern-seeking missiles in a random universe. We see faces in clouds, purpose in coincidence, agency in chaos. Religion says: "Yes, those patterns are real. The universe does care."

But religion isn't just false comfort. It's social technology. "God is watching" works better than any police force. Shared beliefs bind strangers into brothers. Sacred rituals synchronize entire populations.

Religion solves the cooperation problem: why should I help you if we're not related? Because God says so. Why should I die for the group? Because paradise awaits. Religion makes irrational behavior rational by changing the rules of the game.
