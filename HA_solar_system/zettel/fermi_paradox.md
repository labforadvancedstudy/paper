# Fermi Paradox

## Core Insight
If the universe is vast and old, where is everybody? The silence of the cosmos despite billions of opportunities for life suggests something profound about life, intelligence, or survival.

The numbers are staggering. Hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy. Billions of years for evolution. Thousands of confirmed exoplanets. Yet Earth seems surrounded by silence. No radio signals. No megastructures. No visitors. Fermi's question echoes: if life is probable, where are they?

Solutions multiply like conspiracies. Maybe life is incredibly rare (Great Filter). Maybe intelligence is the bottleneck. Maybe civilizations self-destruct. Maybe they're hiding. Maybe we're early. Maybe we're in a zoo. Each solution has disturbing implications. If the Great Filter is behind us, we're incredibly lucky. If it's ahead, we're doomed. The Fermi Paradox transforms the Solar System from one among billions to possibly unique - either in harboring life or in being observed by it.
