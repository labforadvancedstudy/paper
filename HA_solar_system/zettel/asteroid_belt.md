# Asteroid Belt

## Core Insight
Between Mars and Jupiter lies a junkyard of planetary construction - millions of rocks that never became a planet, preserved evidence of the Solar System's violent youth.

The asteroid belt isn't science fiction's dense field of tumbling rocks but mostly empty space with scattered debris. These fragments - from dust grains to dwarf planet Ceres - are leftovers from planet formation. Jupiter's gravity prevented them from coalescing, keeping them suspended in orbital purgatory for billions of years.

Yet this cosmic debris field tells stories. Different asteroid types reveal different origins: carbon-rich C-types from the outer system, silicate S-types from inner regions, metallic M-types that were once cores of shattered protoplanets. The belt is a frozen museum of the early Solar System, holding clues to how planets formed and why Earth has water. Sometimes what doesn't happen is as important as what does.
