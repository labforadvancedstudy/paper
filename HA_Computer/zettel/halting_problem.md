# Halting Problem

## Core Insight
The first mathematical proof that computers have limits - some questions are undecidable by nature, not difficulty.

Can we write a program that predicts whether any program will halt or loop forever? Turing proved: no. The halting problem isn't hard - it's impossible. Like asking "What's north of the North Pole?" The question breaks the system.

This shattered the dream of mechanical mathematics. There are truths no algorithm can find, problems no computer can solve, not because we're not clever enough, but because computation itself has boundaries. The universe includes the uncomputable.
