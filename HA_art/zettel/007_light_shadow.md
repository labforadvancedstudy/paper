# Light Shadow

## Core Insight
Light creates and shadow reveals - together they perform the daily magic show that teaches us form, depth, time, and mood without words.

Watch light move across a room through the day. Morning: long shadows, golden warmth. Noon: short shadows, harsh clarity. Evening: shadows stretch and soften. This is time made visible, the universe's first clock.

Light and shadow speak:
- Sharp shadows: bright sun, clear day, certainty
- Soft shadows: clouds, fog, mystery
- No shadow: overcast, flat, melancholy  
- Multiple shadows: artificial lights, confusion
- Moving shadows: time passing, life flowing
- Colored shadows: magic hours, other worlds

Artists chase light. Rembrandt built faces from darkness. Caravaggio made light divine violence. Impressionists painted light itself, objects secondary. They knew: light is the subject, everything else is excuse to show light.

Shadow holds equal power. It:
- Creates depth (2D becomes 3D)
- Hides information (mystery, fear)
- Defines form (shows volume)
- Carries metaphor (Jung's shadow self)
- Makes negative space active

Children fear shadows before they understand them. They're right - shadows are where solid becomes void, where things half-exist. Artists use this primal response. Film noir. Gothic architecture. Shadows carry emotional weight light cannot.

Your eye evolved for this dance. We see because of contrast. Pure light blinds. Pure dark blinds. Life exists in between.
