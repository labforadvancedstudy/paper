# Delta-v

## Core Insight
The currency of space travel - not distance but velocity change, the brutal accounting that determines where you can go and whether you can come back.

Delta-v (Δv) is change in velocity, but in space it means so much more. It's your energy budget, your range, your capability. Every maneuver costs delta-v. Run out, and you're stuck wherever physics left you.

Why delta-v matters more than distance:
- Reaching orbit needs ~9.4 km/s (fighting gravity)
- Reaching Moon needs ~12.5 km/s total
- Mars? ~13-15 km/s depending on trajectory
- But staying in orbit? 0 km/s (already falling forever)

The rocket equation is tyrannical:
Δv = v_exhaust × ln(m_initial/m_final)

This logarithm is cruel:
- Double your fuel doesn't double your delta-v
- Each additional km/s costs exponentially more mass
- High exhaust velocity is precious
- Every gram of spacecraft reduces delta-v budget

Delta-v maps show the cosmic toll booth prices:
- LEO to GEO: 4.2 km/s
- Earth escape: 3.2 km/s from LEO
- Mars transfer: 3.6 km/s
- Jupiter? 6.3 km/s (and good luck stopping)

But gravity assists and aerobraking cheat the system:
- Steal velocity from planets
- Use atmospheres as free brakes
- Trade time for delta-v with efficient trajectories

In space, delta-v is more fundamental than distance. You can be 100 km from something and unable to reach it. You can travel millions of kilometers on clever trajectories using minimal delta-v. It's not about how far. It's about how fast you need to change.
