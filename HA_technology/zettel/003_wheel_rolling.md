# Wheel Rolling

## Core Insight
The wheel is humanity's first victory over friction - transforming the drag of reality into the smoothness of rotation, making the impossible inevitable.

Watch a wheel roll. It's perpetual falling that never hits ground. Each point touches earth briefly then rises again. It's continuous leverage, every moment a new fulcrum. The wheel doesn't fight friction; it recruits it.

Before wheels: dragging, carrying, limiting. After wheels: rolling, transporting, expanding. The wheel made distance negotiable. It turned "too far" into "how fast?" It's pure abstraction made physical - the circle, mathematics' perfect form, solving engineering's messiest problem.

Every bearing, gear, turbine, and hard drive descends from this insight: rotation transforms forces. The wheel teaches that sometimes the solution isn't to push harder but to change the geometry of the problem.
