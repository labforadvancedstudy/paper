# Meaning

## Core Insight
The value we project onto a universe that doesn't care - and why that's beautiful.

## The Construction Site

Meaning doesn't exist in atoms or void. A universe of just particles has no meaning. Meaning emerges when consciousness creates categories: good/bad, beautiful/ugly, important/trivial.

L1: Meaning is pleasure and pain
L2: Meaning is divine purpose
L3: Meaning is virtue and excellence
L4: Meaning is duty and reason
L5: Meaning is authenticity
L6: Meaning is language games
L7: Meaning is power relations
L8: Meaning is information processing
L9: Meaning is the question itself

The existentialist discovery: meaning isn't found, it's made. The universe is a blank canvas, and consciousness is the artist.
