# Launch Viewing

## Core Insight
The ground shakes, light brighter than the sun erupts, and tons of metal rise on a pillar of fire - humanity's controlled explosion against the tyranny of gravity, witnessed with your whole body.

You feel a rocket launch before you see it. If you're close enough (and you should get close at least once), the sound arrives late but arrives completely. Not just through your ears but through your chest, your bones, the ground beneath your feet. It's subsonic thunder that rewrites your understanding of power.

The sequence burns into memory:
- The hold-your-breath countdown
- Ignition's silent flash (light travels faster)
- The climbing fireball fighting Earth's pull
- The sound wall hitting you seconds later
- The continuous roar that seems impossible
- The emotional surge as it keeps going up
- The strange grief when it disappears into sky

Physical sensations layer:
- Heat on your face from miles away
- Chest cavity resonating with acoustic energy
- Ground vibration through your feet
- Eyes watering from brightness
- Involuntary grinning or crying

Watching a launch rewires something primal. Your body knows this shouldn't work - too heavy, too violent, too impossible. Yet there it goes, turning dinosaur juice into altitude, carrying human dreams on controlled explosions.

Every launch is someone's first. Every launch might be something's last. Every launch is humanity spitting in gravity's eye.
