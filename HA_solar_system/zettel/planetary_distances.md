# Planetary Distances

## Core Insight
The spacing between planets follows mysterious mathematical patterns - not random scatter but organized intervals that hint at deep principles governing Solar System architecture.

Measure the distances from Sun to planets and patterns emerge. The Titius-Bode law predicted planetary positions with eerie accuracy - until Neptune broke the pattern. Yet the spacing isn't random. Inner planets pack close, each roughly 1.5 times farther than the previous. Outer planets spread wide, with vast gaps between giants. This spacing tells formation stories.

The distances determine everything: temperature, composition, evolution. Inside the frost line, only rock and metal could condense - hence small, rocky planets. Beyond it, ice could form - hence giants that captured hydrogen. The asteroid belt sits where a planet might have formed but Jupiter's gravity prevented it. Distance from the Sun is destiny. In the simple list of planetary distances lies the blueprint for the Solar System's diversity.
