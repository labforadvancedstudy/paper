# Found Wonder

## Core Insight
When ordinary objects suddenly reveal extraordinary beauty - a rusted can becomes sculpture, shadows form faces - showing that art exists before artists make it.

You're walking. Something stops you. A crack in pavement draws a perfect river. Peeling paint makes a landscape. Rust blooms like flowers. You didn't create this, you discovered it. Your eye made it art by seeing it as art.

Found wonder appears in:
- Natural accidents (water stains, erosion patterns)
- Urban decay (graffiti layers, weathered posters)  
- Light accidents (shadows, reflections, refractions)
- Arrangements (scattered leaves, gathered stones)
- Juxtapositions (nature vs. human-made)
- Aging (patina, fading, wearing)

This seeing-as-art changes everything. Duchamp's urinal. Warhol's soup cans. They didn't make, they pointed: "Look. See differently." The artist's first job: recognition. Creation comes later, maybe.

Children excel at found wonder. A stick becomes treasure. A puddle holds the sky. They don't distinguish between made-art and found-art. Beauty is beauty. Interest is interest. Adults must relearn this.

Found wonder teaches:
- Beauty exists without intention
- Context creates meaning  
- Attention is creation
- Art predates artists
- World is already full

Photography's truth: it's all finding, not making. The world composes itself. We just notice when the composition works.
