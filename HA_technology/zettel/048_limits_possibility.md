# Limits of Possibility

## Core Insight
Technology's limits aren't just physical but logical - there are things that cannot be built not because we lack knowledge but because they violate the structure of reality itself.

Physical limits are obvious: speed of light, thermodynamics, quantum uncertainty. But deeper limits lurk: logical contradictions (omnipotence paradox), computational limits (halting problem), information limits (no cloning theorem).

Yet every limit spawns workarounds. Can't exceed light speed? Bend space. Can't violate thermodynamics? Export entropy. Can't solve halting problem? Use heuristics. Limits don't stop technology; they redirect it.

The ultimate limit might be comprehension itself. Can finite minds understand infinite complexity? Can consciousness comprehend consciousness? Perhaps technology's final limit is the builders' ability to understand what they've built.
