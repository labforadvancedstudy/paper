# Angular Momentum

## Core Insight
The Solar System's rotation is a fossil from its birth - angular momentum conserved for billions of years, determining everything from planetary orbits to the direction you swirl your coffee.

When the primordial cloud collapsed to form our Solar System, it had slight rotation. As it shrank, it spun faster - like an ice skater pulling in their arms. This spin couldn't disappear; angular momentum is conserved. It determined that planets would orbit counterclockwise (viewed from north), that the Sun would rotate, that most planets would spin the same direction.

But angular momentum tells deeper stories. Jupiter holds most of the Solar System's angular momentum despite the Sun having most mass. Venus spins backward - something stole its original momentum and reversed it. Tidal forces transfer angular momentum from Earth's rotation to Moon's orbit. In every spin, orbit, and rotation, we see the ghost of that original cloud's lazy rotation, amplified by gravity's collapse and preserved by physics' most stubborn conservation law.
