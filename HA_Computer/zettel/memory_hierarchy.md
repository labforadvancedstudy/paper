# Memory Hierarchy

## Core Insight
Computers organize memory like we organize our lives - keep the important stuff close, archive the rest.

Registers (nanoseconds away) hold what you're thinking right now. Cache (microseconds) holds recent thoughts. RAM (milliseconds) holds today's context. Disk (eternities away) holds everything else. Each level trades speed for size - fast memory is expensive, big memory is slow.

This hierarchy mirrors consciousness itself. Working memory, short-term memory, long-term memory - brains and computers solving the same problem: infinite information, finite fast access. The art is guessing what you'll need before you need it.
