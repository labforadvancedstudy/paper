# Disruption Patterns

## Core Insight
Disruption follows patterns - new entrants attack from below with "worse" products that improve rapidly, eventually displacing incumbents who fled upmarket.

The pattern repeats: PCs disrupted mainframes. Smartphones disrupted PCs. Cloud disrupted on-premise. Each disruptor starts inferior on traditional metrics but superior on new dimensions: cheaper, simpler, more accessible. Quality improves faster than needs.

Incumbents see disruption coming but can't respond. Their customers don't want "worse" products. Their economics require high margins. Their processes optimize for sustaining innovation. By the time disruption threatens core business, it's too late.

But disruption isn't destiny. Some incumbents transform: Netflix from DVD to streaming. Others acquire disruptors. Many create separate units to self-disrupt. The key is recognizing that yesterday's competitive advantage becomes tomorrow's anchor.
