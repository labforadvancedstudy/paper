# Money

## Core Insight
Humanity's most successful fiction - a shared delusion so powerful it becomes more real than reality.

Money is pure social construction that constructs social reality. Paper and pixels worthless in themselves, valuable only through collective agreement. Yet this "fiction" builds cities, starts wars, saves and destroys lives. The imaginary made material.

Money is crystalized trust, labor, and time. Also power, freedom, and constraint. It's society's universal translator - converting everything into everything else. Hours become houses, ideas become food, beauty becomes security.

The money paradox: we created it to serve us but live serving it. Markets meant to express human values now define them. The tool reshapes the user. Yet without money's abstracting power, complex society collapses into barter and localism.
