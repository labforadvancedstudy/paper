# Code

## Core Insight
Code is crystallized thought - human intention made executable by machines.

Code is the fundamental medium of software engineering. It's text that has dual citizenship: readable by humans, executable by machines. This duality creates the central tension in all software development.

At its essence, code is a formal language for expressing computation. But unlike mathematical notation, code must be unambiguous - the machine demands precision where human languages thrive on ambiguity.

Code exists in time. It's written once but read many times. It's born, it grows, it ages, it dies. Sometimes it becomes undead (legacy code).

The paradox: code is written for machines to execute but must be written for humans to understand.
