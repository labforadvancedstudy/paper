# Price Signals

## Core Insight
The economy's nervous system: prices transmit information faster than words - distributed computation via numbers.

Price signals are information compression at cosmic scale. The price of coffee contains: weather in Brazil, shipping costs, labor disputes, consumer preferences, competitor actions, future expectations - all compressed into $4.99.

Signal characteristics:
- **Dense information** - thousands of factors in one number
- **Rapid transmission** - changes propagate instantly
- **Action-inducing** - high price = produce more
- **Decentralized** - no central processor needed
- **Universal language** - numbers cross all barriers

Price signals coordinate without communication:
- Shortage → price rises → consumption falls, production rises
- Surplus → price falls → consumption rises, production falls
- Innovation → costs fall → price signals spread efficiency
- Disaster → supply disrupted → price signals scarcity

The profound insight: prices calculate what no computer could - the optimal allocation of resources across billions of decisions. It's parallel processing using humans as nodes.

Yet signals can be noisy, manipulated, misread. Financial markets generate price signals about price signals, creating recursive loops that sometimes explode.
