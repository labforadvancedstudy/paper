# Category Theory - The Mathematics of Mathematics

## Core Insight
Category theory abstracts the notion of structure and structure-preserving transformations - it's the mathematics of mathematical relationships.

## Content
Mathematics studies objects: numbers, spaces, groups. Category theory studies the relationships between these studies. It's meta-mathematics that reveals hidden patterns across all of mathematics.

A category consists of:
- Objects (not sets, just "things")
- Morphisms (arrows between objects)
- Composition (arrows can be chained)
- Identity (every object has a "do nothing" arrow)

Examples clarify:
- Set: objects are sets, morphisms are functions
- Grp: objects are groups, morphisms are homomorphisms
- Top: objects are spaces, morphisms are continuous maps
- Vect: objects are vector spaces, morphisms are linear maps

But the magic is in the patterns:
- Functors: mappings between categories
- Natural transformations: mappings between functors
- Limits and colimits: universal constructions
- Adjunctions: optimal solutions

Key insights:
- It's not about objects, it's about relationships
- Universal properties characterize objects uniquely
- Everything is defined by how it relates to everything else
- The same pattern appears everywhere

The Yoneda lemma states: an object is completely determined by its relationships. You are what you do.

Category theory revealed that mathematics has a mathematics - and it's beautiful.
