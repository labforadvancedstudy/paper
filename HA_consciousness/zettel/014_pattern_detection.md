# 014 Pattern Detection - Finding Regularities

The brain's core function: extracting order from chaos.
Statistics made flesh.

## Levels
1. **Feature detection**: Edges, colors, tones
2. **Object recognition**: Combining features
3. **Sequence learning**: Temporal patterns
4. **Abstract patterns**: Rules, categories

## Neural Implementation
- Receptive fields: Tuned to specific patterns
- Hierarchical processing: Simple → complex
- Invariance: Recognizing despite changes
- Sparse coding: Efficient representation

## Examples
- V1 neurons: Edge detectors
- Fusiform face area: Face specialists
- Hippocampus: Spatial patterns
- Language areas: Grammar patterns

## Significance
Pattern detection = meaning extraction = understanding.
Consciousness might be pattern detection turned inward.

Without patterns, only noise. With patterns, a world.
