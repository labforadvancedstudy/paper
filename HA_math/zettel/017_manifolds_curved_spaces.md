# Manifolds and Curved Spaces

## Core Insight
Manifolds are spaces that look flat up close but can be curved globally - like Earth's surface appears flat to us but is actually spherical.

## Content
Stand on Earth. Look around. It seems flat. Yet Earth is round. This paradox is the essence of manifolds: locally Euclidean, globally possibly exotic.

A manifold is:
- Locally like ℝⁿ (you can make maps)
- Globally possibly twisted (maps might not fit together simply)
- Smooth enough for calculus
- The natural home for physics

Examples illuminate:
- Circle: 1-manifold, locally like a line
- Sphere: 2-manifold, locally like a plane
- Torus: 2-manifold, locally flat but globally different from sphere
- Spacetime: 4-manifold, curved by mass-energy

The magic is in the coordinates:
- Charts: local coordinate systems
- Atlas: collection of charts
- Transition maps: how charts relate
- Smooth structure: calculus works

Curvature emerges:
- Intrinsic: detectable from within (Gauss's Theorema Egregium)
- Extrinsic: how it sits in ambient space
- Riemann tensor: complete curvature information
- Einstein's insight: gravity is spacetime curvature

Applications profound:
- General relativity: universe as manifold
- Gauge theory: physics on principal bundles
- Robotics: configuration spaces
- Machine learning: data on manifolds

Manifolds showed us that space itself can be an object of study.
