# Quantum Economics

## Core Insight
Economics exhibits quantum-like properties - observation changes outcomes, uncertainty principles limit knowledge, and economic reality exists in superposition until "measured" by transactions.

Consider observer effects. When the Federal Reserve watches inflation, markets change behavior. Goodhart's Law captures this: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." The act of economic observation fundamentally alters what's being observed.

Uncertainty principles abound. You can know a asset's price precisely or its liquidity, but not both perfectly. High-frequency trading knows prices to microseconds but has no idea about fundamental value. Long-term investors know value but can't predict short-term prices. Precision in one dimension means uncertainty in another.

Superposition exists in markets. A company is simultaneously worth every price between bid and ask until a transaction "collapses" it to a specific value. Schrodinger's stock - it's both up and down until you check your portfolio.

Entanglement appears in correlations. When one market moves, entangled markets move instantly, faster than information should travel. Quantum tunneling happens when prices jump discretely through "impossible" ranges without touching intermediate values.

Is this just metaphor? Maybe. But maybe economics, dealing with information and observation, shares deep structure with quantum mechanics. Both describe systems where classical intuitions fail and measurement creates reality.

The implication: perhaps we need a new economic mechanics that embraces uncertainty and observer effects rather than pretending they don't exist.
