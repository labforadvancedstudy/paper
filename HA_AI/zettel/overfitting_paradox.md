# Overfitting Paradox

## Core Insight
AI can memorize perfectly and understand nothing - like a student who memorizes answers without grasping questions, revealing the gap between pattern matching and comprehension.

Train too long and strange things happen. The AI becomes a savant for training data, achieving perfect scores. But show it something slightly new and it fails catastrophically. It memorized the answers, not the principles. Like learning multiplication by memorizing every possible problem instead of understanding the operation.

This paradox illuminates AI's deepest challenge: generalization. True intelligence extrapolates, improvises, handles the never-before-seen. Overfitting shows us AI at its most artificial - brittle expertise that shatters outside its training distribution. The cure? Deliberately forgetting (dropout), early stopping, or showing more diversity. Teaching AI to learn, not just remember.
