# Law

## Core Insight
Power crystallized into words - the attempt to make human behavior as predictable as physics through written rules backed by force.

Law performs an astonishing trick: it transforms violence into procedure. Instead of the strong simply taking from the weak, there are rules, processes, papers. The violence is still there (try breaking the law), but hidden beneath ritual and rhetoric.

Law exists in the tension between:
- Is and ought (descriptive vs prescriptive)
- Letter and spirit (what's written vs what's meant)
- Universal and particular (general rules vs specific cases)
- Rigid and flexible (certainty vs justice)

The magic of law is its self-referential nature. Laws say what law is. Legal systems determine their own validity. It's a collective hallucination that becomes real through enforcement.

But law is never just rules. It's:
- A language (legal terminology)
- A profession (lawyers, judges)
- A performance (trials, ceremonies)
- A belief system (justice, rights)
- A violence machine (police, prisons)

The deepest paradox: law exists to constrain power, but requires power to exist. Every legal system contains this contradiction at its heart.
