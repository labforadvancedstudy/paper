# Value

## Core Insight
The economic mystery: what makes something worth something? Value is desire crystallized into measure.

Value is economics' most slippery concept. Is water valuable? Not to someone drowning, infinitely to someone in a desert. Value isn't in things - it's in the relationship between things and wants.

Value emerges from:
- **Utility** - how well it satisfies wants
- **Scarcity** - how hard to obtain
- **Labor** - how much work went in
- **Exchange** - what others will trade
- **Perception** - what we believe it's worth

Types of value:
- Use value (it does something)
- Exchange value (others want it)
- Symbolic value (it means something)
- Intrinsic value (if that exists)
- Subjective value (to me, now)

The profound question: does anything have "real" value, or is all value a collective hallucination? Markets say value is what someone will pay. Philosophers say value transcends price. Both are right.

Value is the bridge between physics and desire, between atoms and meaning. It's what transforms mere matter into wealth.
