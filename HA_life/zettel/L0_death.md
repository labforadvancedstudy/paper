# Death

## Core Insight
The price of being alive is having to stop - the non-negotiable contract that makes life precious by making it finite.

Death is life's shadow, defining it by contrast. You can't understand what it means to be alive without knowing you won't be. Every heartbeat is numbered, every breath is borrowed. This isn't morbid - it's the fundamental tension that drives everything living.

We know death first through others. The pet that stops moving. The grandparent who doesn't wake up. The flower that wilts. Long before we understand our own mortality, we see that things that were alive become not-alive. The transition is absolute - no halfway states, no partial death. Like a light switch: on or off.

But when exactly does it happen? When the heart stops? The brain? The last cell? Death seems instantaneous but is actually a cascade. Systems fail in sequence. The organism dies, then organs, then tissues, then cells. Life doesn't leave all at once - it drains away.

The cruelest gift: consciousness of mortality. We're the only species that knows it will die, that lives every day in death's shadow. This knowledge shapes everything - art, religion, love, ambition. We build, create, and cherish because we know time is limited. Death makes life urgent.
