# Redshift Discovery

## Core Insight
The discovery that galaxies' light shifts red proportional to distance revealed the universe is expanding - space itself stretches, carrying galaxies apart like raisins in rising dough.

Vesto Slipher measured galaxy spectra in 1912, finding most showed redshift - spectral lines displaced toward longer wavelengths. Initially interpreted as Doppler shift from recession velocity, it seemed galaxies were fleeing us. Edwin Hubble's breakthrough came in 1929: comparing distances (via Cepheid variables) to redshifts revealed a linear relationship. More distant galaxies recede faster.

But the interpretation evolved. It's not galaxies moving through space - space itself expands. Light waves stretch as they travel through expanding space, shifting red. This cosmological redshift differs from Doppler shift, though the math is similar for nearby galaxies. The discovery transformed cosmology from philosophy to science. Working backwards from expansion implied a beginning - the Big Bang. Measuring expansion rate reveals the universe's age and fate. One spectral shift measurement launched modern cosmology.
