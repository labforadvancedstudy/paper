# Startup Evolution

## Core Insight
Startups are organizational embryos - beginning as pure potential, rapidly evolving through developmental stages, either achieving sustainable form or dying in infancy.

The startup journey mirrors biological development. Conception: idea meets founders. Gestation: building in stealth. Birth: launching to market. Infancy: finding product-market fit. Adolescence: scaling chaos. Maturity: sustainable operations. Each stage has different needs, different mortality risks.

Evolution accelerates under pressure. Resource constraints force innovation. Competition drives adaptation. Customer feedback shapes direction. The startup either evolves fast enough to survive or joins the 90% that don't. Natural selection in market form.

But startups aren't just small companies - they're different species. Designed for search, not execution. Optimized for learning, not efficiency. Built to find scalable models, not operate them. The transition from startup to company is metamorphosis, not just growth.
