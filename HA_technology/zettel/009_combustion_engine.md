# Combustion Engine

## Core Insight
The engine is fire in a box - transforming the violence of explosion into the grace of rotation, turning chemical rage into mechanical poetry.

Combustion engines capture what fire wants to waste. Free combustion expands in all directions, mostly heating air. The engine says: expand HERE, push THIS, turn THAT. It channels chaos into cycles.

The four-stroke dance: suck (intake), squeeze (compression), bang (power), blow (exhaust). It's breathing made mechanical, metabolism made metal. Each cylinder is a controlled catastrophe, thousand tiny explosions per minute serving our motion needs.

From steam engines to jets, the principle remains: contain expansion, extract work. It's humanity's bargain with entropy - we'll let you increase, but first push this piston. The engine is our greatest negotiation with thermodynamics.
