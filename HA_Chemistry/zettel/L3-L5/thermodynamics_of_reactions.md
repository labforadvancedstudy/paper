# Thermodynamics of Reactions

## Core Insight
Free energy determines reaction spontaneity - nature flows toward lower energy and higher entropy, seeking the sweet spot between order and chaos.

Will it react? Thermodynamics answers. ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. Negative means spontaneous. But spontaneous doesn't mean fast - diamonds converting to graphite is spontaneous but takes eons.

Enthalpy (ΔH) counts bond energies. Breaking bonds costs energy, forming releases it. Entropy (ΔS) counts disorder. More particles, more arrangements, higher entropy. Temperature (T) weights entropy's importance - high temperature favors disorder.

Ice melting demonstrates the balance. Below 0°C, enthalpy wins - ordered ice is favored. Above 0°C, entropy wins - disordered water is favored. At exactly 0°C, they balance. The universe's books must balance.
