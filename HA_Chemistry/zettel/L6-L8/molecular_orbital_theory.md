# Molecular Orbital Theory

## Core Insight
Atomic orbitals combine into molecular orbitals that span entire molecules - electrons belong to the molecule, not individual atoms.

Forget Lewis structures with their neat electron pairs. Reality is messier and more beautiful. When atoms approach, their orbitals mix like waves - constructive interference creates bonding orbitals, destructive creates antibonding.

Benzene exemplifies the truth. Six carbons, six p-orbitals combine into six molecular orbitals. Three bonding, three antibonding. The electrons delocalize across the entire ring. No single bonds, no double bonds - just a continuous electron cloud above and below the ring.

This explains aromaticity, conjugation, metallic conduction. Electrons aren't localized between atom pairs but spread across molecular systems. The bigger the delocalization, the more stable the molecule. Graphene takes this to the extreme - electrons delocalized across entire sheets.
