# Cognitive Load

## Core Insight
The brutal constraint that makes HA necessary - our minds can only hold ~7±2 items, forcing us to chunk, compress, and climb abstraction ladders.

Cognitive load isn't a bug; it's why HA exists. If we could hold infinite detail, we wouldn't need levels. But our working memory is tiny. Try multiplying 47,293 × 86,544 in your head. Impossible? That's cognitive load limiting you.

So we abstract. Instead of remembering every person, we have "friends." Instead of tracking every transaction, we have "bank balance." Instead of modeling every atom, we have "temperature." Abstraction is cognition's survival strategy.

The fascinating part: cognitive load is itself hierarchical. You can hold ~7 words, or ~7 sentences, or ~7 paragraphs, or ~7 chapters. Same limit, different levels. The constraint scales with abstraction level.

This explains why good explanations climb gradually. Jump too many levels and you exceed cognitive load. Stay at one level too long and you waste cognitive capacity. The art is matching abstraction pace to cognitive limits.
