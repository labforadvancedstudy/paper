# Technological Determinism

## Core Insight
Technological determinism asks: do we drive technology or does it drive us? The answer is yes - we're locked in a feedback loop where creation shapes creator.

The strong version claims technology determines social structure. Printing press creates democracy. Internet creates globalization. Smartphone creates attention economy. Technology as destiny - we just live in its wake.

The nuanced view sees co-evolution. We create technologies from our needs, but they create new needs. We shape tools, then they shape us. It's not determinism but dialogue - a conversation where both parties change.

From agriculture determining settlement to AI determining employment: technology channels history. Not inevitably but probabilistically. Each technology opens some futures, closes others. We choose technologies; they choose our choices.
