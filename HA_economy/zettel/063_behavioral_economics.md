# Behavioral Economics

## Core Insight
Behavioral economics is what happens when economics finally admits that humans aren't robots - we're predictably irrational creatures driven by biases, emotions, and mental shortcuts.

Traditional economics assumes homo economicus - a perfectly rational calculator maximizing utility. Behavioral economics studies homo sapiens - the confused ape who buys gym memberships in January and forgets by February.

Kahneman and Tversky documented our bugs. Loss aversion: we hate losing $100 more than we enjoy gaining $100. Anchoring: the first number we see biases all subsequent judgments. Availability heuristic: we overweight recent, vivid events. Confirmation bias: we see what confirms our beliefs.

These aren't random errors - they're systematic. Everyone makes them, in predictable ways. This transforms economics from physics (rational laws) to psychology (messy humans).

The implications ripple everywhere. Marketing exploits our biases. "Was $100, now $50!" works even when it was never $100. Financial advisors exist partly because we're terrible at thinking about future selves. Nudges work because small changes in presentation create large changes in behavior.

But there's a deeper question: if humans are so irrational, how did markets ever seem to work? Maybe irrationalities cancel out. Maybe markets are rational even if individuals aren't. Or maybe we've been measuring the wrong things all along.

Behavioral economics doesn't just tweak economic models - it questions what economics is modeling.
