# Social Time

## Core Insight
Time isn't natural but social - different societies live in different temporalities that shape everything else.

Clock time seems universal but is recent and weird. Pre-modern time flowed with seasons, rituals, and rhythms. "When the corn is knee-high" was precise enough. Industrial time mechanized humans: punch in, lunch break, punch out. Digital time fragments into microseconds of attention.

Different social times coexist tensely. Corporate quarterly thinking clashes with environmental deep time. Instagram's eternal present contradicts history's long memory. Traditional cultures circle while modern cultures arrow forward.

The temporal paradox: we created clocks to coordinate society, but clock time now coordinates us. We live by schedules that optimize neither human rhythms nor cosmic ones, but the rhythms of capital and information. Social time shapes social being.
