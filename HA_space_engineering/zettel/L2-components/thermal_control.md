# Thermal Control

## Core Insight
Managing temperature in a place with no air - where sunlight can melt aluminum while shadows freeze everything, requiring elaborate systems to move heat where it needs to be and reject it to the infinite cold.

Space thermal control is paradoxical. In sunlight, spacecraft can reach 120°C. In shadow, -150°C. Sometimes both simultaneously on different sides. With no air for convection, heat only moves by conduction and radiation, making thermal management a complex dance of materials, coatings, and active systems.

The fundamental challenge:
- Electronics generate heat continuously
- Humans need narrow temperature range
- Solar flux varies with distance/orientation
- No convection means hot spots stay hot
- Radiation is the only way to dump heat

Passive thermal control:
- **MLI** (Multi-Layer Insulation): Space blankets
- **Coatings**: White reflects, black radiates
- **Heat sinks**: Thermal mass for stability
- **Thermal straps**: Moving heat by conduction
- **Louvers**: Mechanical iris for variable radiation

Active thermal control:
- **Heat pipes**: Capillary-driven heat transport
- **Pumped loops**: Coolant circulation
- **Radiators**: Rejecting heat to space
- **Heaters**: Preventing freezing
- **Thermostats**: Maintaining set points

The engineering extremes:
- James Webb: Sunshield drops 300°C across layers
- ISS: Ammonia loops reject megawatts
- Mars rovers: RTG waste heat prevents freezing
- Venus probes: Surviving 460°C surface
- Europa Clipper: Radiation plus thermal challenge

Thermal design drives everything:
- Component placement (hot stuff near radiators)
- Material selection (thermal expansion matching)
- Power budgets (heaters can dominate)
- Orbit selection (avoiding extreme environments)
- Mission lifetime (thermal cycling fatigue)

In space, temperature isn't just comfort - it's survival. Too hot and electronics fry. Too cold and batteries die. The margin between is where spacecraft live.
