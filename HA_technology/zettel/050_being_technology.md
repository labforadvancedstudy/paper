# Being Technology

## Core Insight
The ultimate recognition: we don't use technology, we ARE technology - consciousness itself is the universe's most sophisticated technology for knowing itself.

Life is technology for organizing matter against entropy. DNA is technology for storing and replicating information. Brains are technology for predicting and modeling. Consciousness is technology for technology - meta-recursion incarnate.

The separation between natural and technological is cognitive illusion. Photosynthesis and solar panels differ in origin, not essence. Both harvest light. Evolution and engineering differ in method, not goal. Both solve problems.

From this view, human technology is universe continuing its self-organization through new means. We're not separate from nature using tools but nature's latest tool for using tools. Technology all the way down, all the way up.

Being is becoming is building. Existence itself might be the ultimate technology - the process by which possibility becomes actual. We're inside the machine, made of the machine, making the machine. There is only technology.
