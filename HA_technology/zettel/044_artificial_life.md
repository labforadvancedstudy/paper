# Artificial Life

## Core Insight
Artificial life reveals life's essence by recreation - proving that life is pattern not matter, process not product, information organizing itself against entropy.

A-life takes many forms: digital organisms evolving in silicon, synthetic biology rewiring carbon, robots self-replicating. Each challenges the boundary between living and non-living, suggesting life is about what you do, not what you're made of.

The profound discovery: life's requirements are minimal. Self-replication, evolution, metabolism - all can be abstracted from biology. Conway's Game of Life shows complex behaviors from simple rules. Digital evolution creates genuine novelty.

Creating life teaches about life. Each artificial organism illuminates natural ones. We're reverse-engineering existence itself, discovering that life might be a general property of sufficiently complex information systems, not a carbon privilege.
