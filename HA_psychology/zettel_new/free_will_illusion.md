# Free Will Illusion

## Core Insight
Your brain decides, then tells you a story about why "you" chose - free will might be post-hoc narrative.

Brain scans show decisions happening before conscious awareness. Your neurons vote, and consciousness gets the press release. "I decided to move my hand" - but the movement signal fired milliseconds before "you" knew. Maybe free will isn't the choosing but the vetoing - consciousness as brake, not gas. We're not puppets, but we're not the puppeteers we think we are either.
