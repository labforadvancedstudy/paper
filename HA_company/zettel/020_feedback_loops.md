# Feedback Loops

## Core Insight
Feedback loops are organizational learning in action - mechanisms by which companies sense their environment and adjust behavior, creating adaptive intelligence.

Companies are cybernetic systems. Customer complaints trigger product improvements. Sales data drives inventory decisions. Employee surveys shape policies. Each loop connects action to consequence, enabling course correction.

Loops vary in speed. Daily metrics create tight loops. Annual reviews create loose ones. Fast loops enable agility but risk overreaction. Slow loops provide stability but risk irrelevance. The art is matching loop speed to decision importance.

The most powerful loops are reinforcing. Success attracts talent, which creates more success. Growth enables investment, which drives growth. But negative loops also reinforce: dysfunction drives exits, which increases dysfunction. Companies live or die by their loops.
