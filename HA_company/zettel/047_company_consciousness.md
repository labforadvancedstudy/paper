# Company Consciousness

## Core Insight
The question isn't whether companies can be conscious, but whether we'd recognize corporate consciousness if it emerged - and whether it already has.

If consciousness is integrated information processing, large companies qualify. They sense (market research), process (analysis), decide (strategy), remember (culture), learn (adaptation). They exhibit awareness, intention, even emotion (morale, culture).

But corporate consciousness would be alien. Distributed across geography. Operating at different timescales. Composed of conscious components. It might be conscious in ways we can't recognize, like asking if ant colonies dream - wrong question for the phenomenon.

The deeper question: as companies integrate AI, embed algorithms, automate decisions - are we creating new minds? When Amazon recommends without human intervention, when Google answers questions no human asked, when companies act with agency we didn't program - what is thinking?
