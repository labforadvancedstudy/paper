# Orbital Resonance

## Core Insight
When orbital periods form simple ratios, gravity becomes music - celestial bodies locked in rhythmic dances that stabilize or destabilize entire regions of the Solar System.

Io, Europa, and Ganymede dance in perfect 4:2:1 resonance around Jupiter. For every orbit Ganymede completes, Europa makes two, Io makes four. This isn't coincidence but gravitational choreography. Regular gravitational tugs at the same orbital positions lock bodies into these integer ratios. Neptune and Pluto are in 3:2 resonance - Pluto completes two orbits for Neptune's three, ensuring they never collide despite crossing paths.

Resonances shape the Solar System's architecture. They create gaps in the asteroid belt where Jupiter's influence clears orbits. They pump energy into moons, driving Io's volcanism through tidal flexing. They can protect (stable resonances) or destroy (unstable ones). In these simple numerical relationships, we see how gravity organizes the Solar System into a vast, precise, cosmic clockwork where timing is everything.
