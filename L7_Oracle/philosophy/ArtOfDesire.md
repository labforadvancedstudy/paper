The Art of Controlling Desire: Desire Logging and AI Feedback - Appetite, Sexuality, and Philosophical Contemplation

Abstract

Humans are beings of desire. From basic needs for survival and reproduction to higher-order desires such as social achievement and self-actualization, desire serves as a powerful driving force in human life. While desire can be a catalyst for personal development and civilization, it can also lead to significant suffering and problems for individuals and society when excessive or misdirected. Therefore, understanding desire, managing it healthily, and ultimately sublimating it in a positive direction are crucial tasks for living a fulfilling human life.

This report focuses on appetite and sexual desire, the most fundamental human desires, and comprehensively explores the impact of suppressing these desires on other desires from philosophical, psychological, and neuroscientific perspectives. Moving beyond theoretical discussions, this report aims to explore practical methods for controlling desire and suggest actionable items that readers can apply to their own lives. In particular, we will delve into the innovative methods of 'desire logging,' which involves recording one's desires daily and gaining insight through objective feedback, and 'AI feedback utilization,' discussing their effectiveness and applicability. Ultimately, this report aims to provide practical assistance to readers in managing their desires and living more autonomous and peaceful lives.

Main Body

1. Desire Suppression and the Desire System

Human desires do not exist in isolation but form a complexly interconnected system. Suppressing one desire can have cascading effects on others, with the outcomes varying based on individual psychological traits, suppression methods, and duration of suppression.

1.1. Philosophical Contemplation

1.1.1. Stoic Philosophy: Control of Desire and Inner Peace

Stoic philosophy regards desire as the primary culprit enslaving humans to external circumstances, viewing freedom from desire as a prerequisite for happiness (Long, 2002). Stoic philosophers aimed for emotional tranquility, or Apatheia, as the ideal state. They believed that desire increases dependence on uncertain external factors and amplifies negative emotions such as anxiety, frustration, and pain. Therefore, true happiness does not depend on external conditions or the fulfillment of desires but can be attained through inner strength—self-control and temperance—to govern oneself.

Key Stoic Philosophical Texts:

Marcus Aurelius, Meditations: Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, Roman Emperor and Stoic philosopher, is a collection of personal reflections that practically presents the core teachings of Stoicism (Hays, 2002). He emphasizes the importance of living according to one's reason and virtue, unwavering by external evaluations or fate. It contains profound reflections on fundamental human issues such as death, pain, and desire. His detached analysis and insights on desire continue to offer valid wisdom to modern individuals.

Epictetus, Enchiridion: Enchiridion by Epictetus, a philosopher of slave origin, is an introductory text that concisely summarizes the core principles of Stoicism (Waterfield, 2008). He clearly distinguishes between what we can control (thoughts, desires, will, etc.) and what we cannot (external environment, evaluations of others, body, etc.), arguing for inner peace by focusing on the controllable inner self. He emphasizes that desire stems from craving for uncontrollable external objects, thus controlling desire is equivalent to controlling oneself.

Seneca, On the Shortness of Life: On the Shortness of Life by Seneca, a Roman philosopher and politician, contains deep insights into the finite nature of time and the value of life (Wilson, 2014). He cautions that chasing pleasures and material desires is a waste of time and that one should pursue genuinely valuable things in fleeting time. Seneca argues that a valuable life is one where you make rational judgments without being immersed in desire, and cultivate virtue and wisdom.

Stoic philosophy does not view desire suppression merely as a passive act of enduring pain but as an active practice of gaining inner freedom and peace by breaking away from attachment to desire. It was believed that through training to rationally control and temper desires, one could cultivate a strong mentality unswayed by external circumstances and attain true happiness.

1.1.2. Epicurean Philosophy: Moderated Pleasure and Happiness

Epicurean philosophy is often misunderstood as hedonism, but true Epicureanism pursues the state of absence of pain—Ataraxia (tranquility, freedom from disturbance) and Aponia (absence of physical pain)—as the highest happiness (Warren, 2009). Epicurus acknowledged pleasure as an important value in life, but did not advocate pursuing all pleasures indiscriminately. Rather, he emphasized that there are different kinds of pleasures, and for sustained, stable happiness, pleasure must be wisely chosen and moderated.

Epicurus's Classification of Desires:

Epicurus categorized desires into three types, suggesting different approaches for each:

Natural and Necessary Desires: Desires essential for survival and health maintenance (food, water, shelter, etc.) must be satisfied. However, these desires are sufficiently met with minimal fulfillment and do not need excessive pursuit.
Natural but Not Necessary Desires: Desires that can make life pleasant but are not essential (delicious food, beautiful clothes, a comfortable home, etc.) should be moderately regulated. Excessive pursuit of these desires can lead to greater pain and anxiety.
Neither Natural nor Necessary Desires: Desires such as social honor, power, and wealth are not derived from human nature and are merely vain desires. These desires must be absolutely suppressed and are not worth pursuing.
Epicurus viewed true happiness as not being in flamboyant, stimulating pleasures, but in mental tranquility and contentment derived from a simple and frugal life. He taught that the secret to happiness is reducing unnecessary desires, being content with natural and necessary desires, and pursuing spiritual values such as friendship and learning. Epicurean philosophy, like Stoicism, suggests a way of life that minimizes pain and pursues lasting happiness through the moderation of desires.

1.1.3. Buddhism: Extinction of Desire and Nirvana

Buddhism explicitly defines desire as the root of suffering, with Nirvana (解脫), complete liberation from desire, as the ultimate goal (Harvey, 2013). In Buddhism, desire is not merely material craving but a broad concept encompassing attachment to existence, indulgence in sensory pleasures, and even yearning for ideals. These various forms of desire are summarized in a single term, Craving (渴愛, Trsna), identified as the fundamental cause of dissatisfaction and suffering.

Buddhist Methods of Desire Suppression:

Buddhism presents the Eightfold Path as a concrete practice for overcoming desire. The Eightfold Path consists of eight elements: Right Understanding, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration. Through this practice, it is taught that one can eradicate the root of desire and escape the suffering of Samsara.

Practice of Compassion (慈悲心, Karuna): Buddhism emphasizes cultivating compassion and empathy for others to overcome self-centered desires. Compassion weakens selfish desires and leads to the practice of altruistic behavior.

Mindfulness (正念, Mindfulness) Practice: Mindfulness practice, being aware of one's thoughts, emotions, and senses in the present moment, stops automatic reactions to desire and allows for an objective observation of the true nature of desire. Through mindfulness, one realizes that desire is only a temporary emotion, not an eternal entity.

Insight into Impermanence (無常, Anicca) and No-self (無我, Anatta): Buddhism emphasizes the truth that everything in the world is constantly changing (impermanence), and that there is no unchanging self (no-self). Deep insight into impermanence and no-self leads to the realization of the transience of desires and encourages letting go of attachment to desire.

Buddhist Scriptures and Modern Interpretations:

***Dhammapada (法句經)***: Dhammapada, an early Buddhist scripture, concisely preaches the dangers of desire and the wisdom of managing desires (Byrom, 1993). It contains teachings that desire is transient and painful, and that escaping from desire is true happiness.

***Heart Sutra (般若心經, Prajnaparamita Hrdaya Sutra)***: Heart Sutra, a central scripture of Mahayana 1  Buddhism, emphasizes the doctrine of Emptiness (空, Sunyata), that all existence is essentially empty (Lopez, 2008). The doctrine of emptiness helps realize that the object of desire is also insubstantial and vain, fundamentally resolving attachment to desire.

Writings of Thich Nhat Hanh: Thich Nhat Hanh, a leading modern Buddhist teacher, presents easily and clearly how to apply mindfulness practice to modern life (Nhat Hanh, 1992; 1999). His books guide readers to manage negative emotions such as stress, anxiety, and anger through mindfulness, wisely regulate desires, and live peacefully.

Buddhism emphasizes suppressing desire, viewing it as the source of suffering, but this is different from mere asceticism. Buddhist desire suppression aims to see through the essence of desire and gain true freedom and happiness by escaping ignorance about desire. The core of Buddhist desire management is not unconditionally suppressing desires, but facing the reality of desire directly, and managing and sublimating desire with wisdom and compassion.

1.2. Psychological Analysis

1.2.1. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs: Basic and Higher Needs

Psychologist Abraham Maslow proposed the Hierarchy of Needs, which arranges human needs hierarchically according to their degree of fulfillment (Maslow, 1943). Maslow categorized human needs into five stages: physiological needs, safety needs, belongingness and love needs, esteem needs, and self-actualization needs, arguing that motivation for higher-stage needs arises only after lower-stage needs are met.

Physiological Needs: The most basic needs essential for survival, including appetite, sexual desire, sleep, thirst, and breathing. According to Maslow's theory, if physiological needs are not met, other needs become secondary. Extreme hunger or unmet sexual desire can focus all human concerns on survival and need fulfillment.

Safety Needs: Needs to pursue physical and emotional safety, seeking stability and freedom from danger, anxiety, and fear. If safety needs are unmet, anxiety and tension increase, making it difficult to try new things or take on challenges.

Belongingness and Love Needs: Needs to feel a sense of belonging in social relationships and to share affection with others. If belongingness and love needs are unmet, individuals are prone to loneliness, isolation, and alienation, and may experience difficulties in social life.

Esteem Needs: Needs to receive recognition and respect from others, and to have positive self-evaluation. Fulfilled esteem needs bring confidence, self-esteem, and achievement, whereas unmet needs can lead to feelings of inferiority, helplessness, and frustration.

Self-actualization Needs: The highest-order needs to maximize one's potential and achieve self-completion. Self-actualization needs emerge after other lower needs are met to some extent and provide continuous motivation for personal growth and development.

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs provides a useful framework for explaining the impact of suppressing basic desires like appetite and sexual desire on other desires. Physiological needs are at the lowest level, so their suppression can affect all other needs. For example, the hypothesis that suppressing appetite and sexual desire may reduce interest in other desires like alcohol or tobacco suggests that basic desire suppression can weaken motivation for higher needs or shift the direction of desire. However, Maslow's theory has limitations in fully explaining the complex factors such as the positive and negative aspects of desire suppression, individual differences, and suppression methods.

1.2.2. Freud's Psychoanalytic Theory: Dynamics of the Id, Ego, and Superego

Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, explained the human psyche by dividing it into three structures: Id, Ego, and Superego. These three structures are in constant interaction, creating human behavior and psychological conflict (Freud, 1923).

Id: The most primitive part of the psychic structure, operating on the pleasure principle. The id seeks only immediate gratification and does not consider social norms, morality, or realistic constraints. Basic biological desires like appetite and sexual desire are representative desires governed by the id.

Ego: Operating on the reality principle, the ego is the psychic structure that strives to satisfy the id's unrealistic desires in realistic ways. The ego recognizes and judges reality, and plays a role in regulating and controlling the timing and methods of satisfying desires. The ego performs the difficult task of maintaining balance between the id's desires, the superego's moral demands, and realistic constraints.

Superego: Operating on the moral principle, the superego is the psychic structure that internalizes social norms, morals, conscience, ideals, etc. The superego monitors and criticizes the ego's actions, compelling moral behavior through guilt and shame. The superego sometimes presents excessively strict and unrealistic moral standards, suppressing the ego.

According to Freud's psychoanalytic theory, appetite and sexual desire are powerful desires of the id, and suppressing them can cause significant psychological conflict. Suppressing the id's desires puts the ego in conflict between the superego's criticism and realistic constraints, which can lead to psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, and neurosis. However, if the ego succeeds in appropriately controlling and sublimating the id's desires, psychological stability and maturity can be achieved. Freud warns against the unconditional dangers of desire suppression, while also suggesting that positive outcomes can be achieved through healthy ego function and sublimation of desires.

1.3. Neuroscientific Approach

1.3.1. Reward System: Neural Circuits of Pleasure and Desire

Neuroscience research has revealed the existence of specific neural circuits in the brain that feel desire and pleasure, known as the Reward System (Schultz, 2016). The reward system is complexly connected across various brain regions, with the mesolimbic dopamine pathway playing a central role. This pathway is involved in various psychological processes such as pleasure, motivation, learning, and addiction.

Operating Principles of the Reward System:

The reward system responds to unexpected positive experiences or rewarding stimuli (food, sexual stimuli, social praise, etc.) by releasing the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine is transmitted to various brain regions, inducing positive emotions such as pleasure, excitement, and satisfaction, and reinforcing specific behaviors to be repeated. For example, when eating delicious food or obtaining sexual satisfaction, the reward system is activated to release dopamine, and these experiences are imprinted in the brain as positive memories, inducing the person to eat food or engage in sexual behavior again.

Desire Suppression and the Reward System:

Suppressing basic desires like appetite and sexual desire can temporarily lower the activation level of the reward system. If food intake or sexual activity that used to stimulate the reward system decreases, the frequency of feeling pleasure and satisfaction decreases, and dopamine release may also decrease. These changes can have the effect of weakening thoughts about other desires or the intensity of desire. For example, during a period of suppressing appetite and sexual desire, cravings for alcohol or tobacco may decrease, or there may be a tendency to focus on other productive activities.

However, long-term desire suppression can negatively affect the reward system. Chronic unmet needs can increase stress hormone secretion and lower the sensitivity of the reward system. Reduced reward system function can lead to psychological problems such as anhedonia, decreased motivation, and depression, and paradoxically, may amplify other desires that more strongly stimulate the reward system (e.g., craving for addictive substances). Therefore, long-term suppression of appetite and sexual desire in an unhealthy manner can rather cause psychological problems and have the counter-effect of strengthening other negative desires.

2. Action Items: Desire Log and AI Feedback for Desire Control

So far, we have gained in-depth understanding of desire through philosophical, psychological, and neuroscientific theories. Now, based on these insights, we propose practical action items to effectively control desire and improve quality of life: 'Desire Logging and AI Feedback Utilization.’ This method can exert an excellent effect in deepening self-reflection, securing objective perspectives, and strengthening continuous desire management capabilities.

2.1. Desire Logging: Desire Recognition and Objectification

The starting point of desire control is to accurately recognize one's own desires. Humans are constantly swept up in various desires and emotions, but most live by unconsciously reacting to desires. 'Desire Logging' is a self-training process, like writing a spiritual diary, to consciously record and objectively reflect on one's desires every day.

How to Write a Desire Log:

Recording Time: Record at a fixed time every day (morning, evening, before bed, etc.) or immediately when feeling a desire. Consistency is important, and it is advisable to use alarms, etc., as it is easy to forget at first.
Recording Contents:
Type of Desire: Record specifically, such as appetite, sexual desire, sleep desire, material desire, need for recognition, anger, jealousy, etc.
Intensity of Desire: Indicate subjective intensity as weak, medium, or strong, or objectify it on a scale of 1 to 10.
Occurrence Situation: Record in detail the context of when, where, with whom, and what you were doing when the desire occurred.
Accompanying Thoughts/Emotions: Record thoughts, emotions, and physical reactions (e.g., anxiety, nervousness, palpitations) that arose with the desire.
Response to Desire: Record whether the desire was fulfilled, suppressed, or resolved in another way, and what the result was.
Recording Format: Write freely without a fixed format, but ensure that key information is included. Various formats such as diary, memo, table, mind map can be utilized, and using digital tools or apps is also efficient.
Honestly and Consistently: It is important to record desires honestly without evaluating or censoring oneself. Rather than expecting effects in just a few days, establishing a habit of long-term consistent recording is key.
Effects of Writing a Desire Log:

Enhanced Recognition of Self-Desire: Through desire logging, you can objectively grasp your desire patterns, frequency, intensity, and triggers. By bringing unconsciously flowing desires to the conscious level, it enhances metacognitive abilities.
Desire Objectification and Distancing: Writing has the effect of separating desire from oneself and observing it objectively. It secures psychological distance to analyze and evaluate desires as if they were someone else's, without being overwhelmed by desire.
Reduced Impulsive Reactions and Rational Judgment: In the process of recording and analyzing desires, you can delay immediate impulsive reactions and gain time to rationally judge the appropriateness, necessity, advantages, and disadvantages of desire. It increases the possibility of conscious choice by breaking away from automatic desire response circuits.
Deepened Self-Reflection and Inner Exploration: Desire logging becomes a deep tool for exploring one's inner self, beyond mere recording. It deepens self-understanding by exploring the root of desire, emotions hidden behind desire, and connections with past experiences, promoting inner growth.
2.2. AI Feedback Utilization: Objective and Neutral Perspective

Desire logging is a powerful tool for self-reflection, but there is also a risk of getting trapped in subjective interpretations or falling into self-rationalization. At this point, AI feedback provides an objective and neutral perspective, overcoming these limitations and maximizing the effects of desire control. Cutting-edge AI technology can analyze desire logs based on vast data and accurately pinpoint patterns and improvements that even human counselors may miss.

How to Utilize AI Feedback:

Utilize AI-based Desire Log Analysis Services: Utilize AI-based chatbots, apps, web services, etc., that are recently being developed to upload desire log data and request feedback. (As it is still in the early stages of commercialization, more diverse services are expected to emerge in the future.)
AI Feedback Request Contents:
Desire Pattern Analysis: Request to analyze overall desire patterns such as main desire types, frequency, intensity, and occurrence situations.
Diagnosis of Irrational Thinking Patterns: Request to diagnose irrational thinking patterns, cognitive distortions, emotional biases, etc., appearing in the desire log.
Direction of Improvement Suggestion: Request points to improve for desire control, concrete action plans that can be practiced, and psychological advice.
Customized Questions: If you want to get in-depth analysis or advice on a specific desire or situation, add specific questions. (e.g., "Recently, there is a pattern of excessive increase in appetite. Please advise on dietary habit improvement.", "In situations where the need for recognition is strong, what is the way to boost self-esteem?")
AI Feedback Acceptance and Internalization: AI feedback provides objective analysis and insights, but it is not an absolute answer. A subjective attitude of critically accepting AI feedback and applying it appropriately to one's own situation and context is important. By reflecting the improvements gained through AI feedback in the desire log and consistently practicing them, you can gradually improve your desire control ability.
Effects of Utilizing AI Feedback:

Objective and Neutral Analysis: AI objectively analyzes desire logs based solely on data, without emotional biases or subjective interpretations. It helps self-objectification by presenting objective data such as desire patterns and hidden psychological vulnerabilities that you were not even aware of.
In-depth Pattern Discovery and Insight Provision: AI demonstrates superior ability compared to humans in quickly analyzing vast data and discovering complex patterns. It provides insightful feedback by deeply analyzing subtle patterns hidden in desire logs, correlations between desires, and correlations between specific situations and desire occurrences.
Customized Improvement Directions and Practical Strategies Presentation: Based on the analysis results of individual desire patterns, AI can present personalized improvement directions and practical strategies. It enhances the effectiveness of desire control by providing solutions optimized for individual characteristics and situations, rather than uniform advice.
Continuous Feedback and Growth Support: AI can provide feedback on desire logs 24/7, acting as a personalized coaching system that supports continuous self-management and growth through consistently recording desire logs and receiving feedback.
3. Precautions When Utilizing Desire Log and AI Feedback

Desire logging and AI feedback utilization are very effective strategies for desire control, but there are several points to be aware of.

Guard against AI Dependence and Maintain Subjective Attitude: AI feedback is only reference material. Rather than blindly following AI opinions, subjective judgment should be prioritized. Remember that AI only assists; the subject of desire control is oneself.
Personal Information Protection and Security: Desire logs contain very personal information, so special attention should be paid to personal information protection and security when using AI services. Choose trustworthy service providers carefully and minimize the risk of personal information leakage.
Continuous Practice and Patience: Rather than bringing dramatic effects in a short period, desire logs and AI feedback can be effective when practiced consistently over the long term. It is important to practice patiently and consistently without being impatient.
Do Not Hesitate to Seek Professional Help When Necessary: If desire control is difficult with desire logs and AI feedback alone, or if you experience psychological difficulties, do not hesitate to seek professional help. Professional intervention such as psychological counseling and psychiatric treatment may be necessary in some cases.
Conclusion

This report philosophically, psychologically, and neuroscientifically explored the impact of suppressing appetite and sexual desire on other desires, and suggested 'Desire Logging and AI Feedback Utilization' as practical action items for desire control. Desire logging is an effective method to increase objective awareness of one's desires and reduce impulsive reactions by creating distance from desires. AI feedback adds objective and in-depth insights to desire log analysis and maximizes the efficiency of desire control by suggesting personalized directions for improvement.

Of course, desire control is not completed in a short period but is a task that requires continuous effort throughout life. However, by consistently utilizing desire logs and AI feedback and applying the philosophical, psychological, and neuroscientific knowledge presented in this report to life, readers can break away from a life swayed by desires, utilize desires as a positive driving force in life, and create a richer, happier life.
