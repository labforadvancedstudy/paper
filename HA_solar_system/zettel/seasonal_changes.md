# Seasonal Changes

## Core Insight
Earth's tilted dance around the Sun creates a four-act play of temperature and life - the axial tilt that makes our planet dynamic rather than static.

Summer's heat, autumn's cooling, winter's cold, spring's warming - this quartet repeats with musical precision. But seasons aren't just temperature; they're angle. The Sun rides high in summer skies, skulks low in winter. The same sunlight that bakes July barely warms January, not because the Sun changed but because Earth tilts.

23.5 degrees. Such a specific number for such profound consequences. This tilt creates the temperate zones where most humanity lives, drives ocean currents, powers weather systems, triggers migrations. Without tilt, no seasons. Without seasons, a different Earth entirely - permanent ice at poles, permanent desert at equator, and life compressed into narrow bands between.
