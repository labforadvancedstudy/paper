# Cognitive Restructuring: Thought Repair

**Core Concept**: Changing thought patterns changes emotional experience and behavior.

## One-Line Definition
Debug your mental software by identifying and fixing cognitive errors.

## Simple Mental Model
Like fixing typos in code - small errors in thinking create big problems in life. Fix the thoughts, fix the feelings.

## Key Mechanism
1. Identify automatic thoughts
2. Examine evidence for/against
3. Develop balanced thoughts
4. Test new perspectives

## Practical Example
"Everyone hates me" becomes "John didn't text back. Maybe he's busy. Sarah invited me to lunch yesterday. The evidence doesn't support 'everyone hates me.'"

## Common Misconception
It's just "positive thinking." Actually, it's accurate thinking - sometimes the accurate thought is negative, and that's okay.
