# Sticky and Slippery

## Core Insight
Molecular grips and molecular slides - surfaces revealing the hidden forces between materials, friction at the chemical level.

Glue hardens, binding paper forever. Soap makes things slippery. Tape sticks then peels. Oil helps things slide. Each is chemistry controlling friction, molecules either gripping tight or sliding past.

Glue works by flowing into tiny crevices, then hardening, creating millions of molecular anchors. Its polymer chains entangle with surface molecules. Soap works oppositely - its molecules get between surfaces, their slippery tails preventing grip.

A child struggling to open a jar discovers that wet hands make it harder - water reduces friction. Adding rubber bands helps - increasing grip. They're manipulating intermolecular forces without knowing it, chemistry through touch.
