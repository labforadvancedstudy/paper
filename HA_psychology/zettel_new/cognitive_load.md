# Cognitive Load

## Core Insight
Your mind has a RAM limit - try to hold too much and everything crashes.

Seven plus or minus two - that's your working memory's magic number. It's why phone numbers were seven digits, why we chunk information, why multitasking is mostly myth. Each thought takes up space in your mental workspace. Add too many and they start falling off the table. Experts seem smarter because they've compressed knowledge into bigger chunks - where you see letters, they see words; where you see moves, they see patterns.
