# Gravitational Lensing

## Core Insight
Mass bends spacetime, which bends light paths - turning galaxy clusters into cosmic telescopes that magnify distant objects and reveal dark matter through distortion patterns.

Einstein predicted in 1915 that gravity bends light, confirmed during the 1919 solar eclipse. Massive objects warp spacetime; light follows these curves, appearing to bend around mass. Galaxy clusters, the universe's most massive structures, create powerful gravitational lenses. Background galaxies appear as arcs or multiple images.

Strong lensing creates Einstein rings - perfect circles when alignment is exact. Weak lensing subtly distorts background galaxy shapes, statistically revealing dark matter distribution. Microlensing occurs when stars pass in front of others, briefly brightening them. Lensing serves multiple purposes: measuring mass (including dark matter), magnifying distant objects for detailed study, finding exoplanets via microlensing, testing general relativity. The first quasar lens showed four images of one object. Hubble's Frontier Fields used cluster lenses to see the universe's first galaxies. Gravity itself becomes a telescope, with galaxy clusters as lenses crafted by cosmic evolution.
