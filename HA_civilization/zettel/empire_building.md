# Empire Building

## Core Insight
Empires are civilization's attempt at fractals - imposing one pattern across infinite diversity.

A kingdom rules similar people. An empire rules everyone - different languages, gods, customs, climates. This is insane. How do you control people who share nothing with you?

Empires discovered: you don't need to change hearts, just behaviors. Pay taxes, follow laws, don't rebel - believe whatever you want. Empires rule bodies, not souls. They're diversity machines pretending to be unity.

But empires do something profound: they create vast peace zones. Inside the empire, a merchant can travel thousands of miles safely. Ideas flow. Technologies spread. Diseases too, but mostly ideas. Empires are civilization's arteries.
