# Artistic Identity

## Core Insight
The performing self - how artists construct and present identity through work, where biography and mythology merge, creating the artist as ultimate artwork.

Artistic identity layers:
- Given identity (background, body, culture)
- Chosen identity (influences, affiliations)
- Projected identity (public persona)
- Work identity (what art says about maker)
- Market identity (brand, recognition)

Historical models persist:
- Suffering genius (Van Gogh)
- Mad visionary (Blake)
- Technical master (Dürer)
- Social rebel (Courbet)
- Celebrity artist (Warhol)

Contemporary pressures intensify:
- Social media constant performance
- Artist statement as literature
- Personal brand requirement
- Diversity/identity politics
- Authenticity demands

Strategies vary:
- Anonymous/pseudonymous (Banksy)
- Collective identity (Guerrilla Girls)
- Multiple personas (Bowie model)
- Hyper-personal (confessional)
- Post-identity (beyond categories)

Work/life boundaries blur:
- Studio practice as performance
- Instagram as artwork
- Life as research
- Biography as material
- Persona as medium

Questions multiply:
- Can work transcend maker?
- Does problematic artist taint art?
- Is coherent identity necessary?
- What about AI artists?
- Who owns collaborative identity?

Market demands consistency. Critics want development. Public craves story. Artist might want invisibility. These tensions shape what gets made, shown, sold, remembered.
