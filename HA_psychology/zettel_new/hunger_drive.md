# Hunger Drive

## Core Insight
Hunger is the body's economics - supply and demand at the cellular level.

When glucose drops, ghrelin rises, and suddenly that boring sandwich looks amazing. Hunger isn't just empty stomach - it's a whole-body conspiracy. The hypothalamus tracks energy, the stomach sends signals, the brain changes how food smells and tastes. It's so fundamental that single-celled organisms do it. We just added consciousness on top.
