# Singularity Concept

## Core Insight
The technological singularity is the event horizon of prediction - the point where exponential change makes the future opaque, like trying to see past the Big Bang but forward.

The argument: technological progress accelerates. Intelligence enhances intelligence. Eventually, artificial intelligence improves itself recursively, rapidly, beyond human comprehension. Change becomes vertical. History ends; something else begins.

Whether real or religious, the concept shapes thinking. It's secular eschatology - rapture for rationalists. It frames progress as destiny, innovation as salvation, AI as messiah or monster. The myth matters more than the math.

Critiques abound: physical limits, complexity barriers, definitional problems. But the core insight remains - exponential change creates discontinuity. At some point, quantity of change becomes qualitative break. The future becomes foreign country.
