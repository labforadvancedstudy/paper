# Identity

## Core Insight
The story we tell about ourselves that becomes true through the telling - the self as social construction project.

"Who are you?" seems simple until you try answering. Name? Role? History? Personality? Identity is the narrative thread connecting past selves to present self to imagined future selves. But the thread is spun from social materials.

Identity is collaborative fiction. You propose an identity ("I'm a rebel"), society responds (acceptance, rejection, modification), you adjust. Through countless iterations, "you" emerges - but it's never just yours. Even resistance identities (punk, outcast) depend on what they resist.

Modern identity is increasingly reflexive - we choose from a menu of possible selves. Traditional societies offered one or two identity templates. We have thousands, but the choosing itself becomes our burden and identity.
