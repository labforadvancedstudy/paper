# Blood

## Core Insight
A liquid organ - the only tissue that flows, carrying life to every corner of your body.

Blood seems simple - red liquid that leaks when you're cut. But zoom in: it's a suspension of cities. Red blood cells (erythrocytes) are delivery trucks, 25 trillion of them, each carrying 270 million hemoglobin molecules. White blood cells patrol like police. Platelets are emergency repair crews.

The plasma - the liquid part - is an ocean of dissolved everything: nutrients, hormones, antibodies, waste, heat, messages. It's 92% water but that 8% contains thousands of different molecules, each with a destination.

Blood is impossibly efficient. One red cell visits your lungs, picks up oxygen, delivers it to your toe, grabs CO2, returns to lungs - all in 60 seconds. It makes this circuit 1,440 times daily until it dies at 120 days old.

Temperature regulation, pH balance, immune defense, clotting, hormone delivery - blood does it all while moving at 3-4 mph through 60,000 miles of vessels. It's the infrastructure that makes multicellular life possible.
