# Sun in Sky

## Core Insight
The Sun is the one celestial object we can't not notice - so bright it defines "day," so reliable we built civilization on its rhythm.

Every human who ever lived knew this truth: bright circle rises, crosses sky, sets. Repeat. The Sun is experience before explanation, warmth before fusion, light before photons. It's the first astronomy lesson every child learns without teaching - don't stare at it, it moves but you don't feel it, it's why shadows dance.

The Sun divides existence into fundamental dualities: day/night, warm/cold, visible/hidden. Before clocks, it was time. Before compasses, it was direction. Before gods, it was god. The Sun doesn't just light the world - it creates the very concept of a world to be lit.
