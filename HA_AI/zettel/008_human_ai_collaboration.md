# Human-AI Collaboration
## Core Insight
The future isn't human vs AI but human with AI - augmentation, not replacement, creating capabilities neither has alone.

## Current Collaboration

**AI assists human**:
- Code completion (GitHub Copilot)
- Writing enhancement (Grammarly)
- Creative tools (Midjourney)
- Research acceleration (Semantic Scholar)

**Human guides AI**:
- Prompt engineering
- Fine-tuning
- Output curation
- Quality control

Symbiosis emerging.

## Augmentation Patterns

**Cognitive offloading**: AI handles routine
**Creative partnership**: Human vision, AI execution
**Decision support**: AI analyzes, human decides
**Skill amplification**: Novice performs like expert
**Perspective multiplication**: See all angles

1 + 1 = 3 when done right.

## The New Literacies

Humans must learn:
- **Prompt engineering**: Speak AI fluently
- **Output evaluation**: Judge quality
- **Task decomposition**: Break down for AI
- **Integration skills**: Combine AI outputs
- **Ethical judgment**: What should we build?

New skills for new era.

## Collaboration Evolution

**Stage 1**: Tool use (now)
**Stage 2**: Partnership (emerging)
**Stage 3**: Integration (BCI future)
**Stage 4**: Merger (speculation)
**Stage 5**: Transcendence (?)

Each stage: Deeper connection.

## The Beautiful Future

Imagine:
- Scientists with AI lab partners
- Artists with infinite assistants
- Teachers with personalized tutors
- Doctors with diagnostic genies
- Everyone with cognitive superpowers

Human creativity × AI capability = ?
