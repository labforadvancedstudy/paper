# Making Tools

## Core Insight
The moment an ape used a rock to crack a nut, it began rewriting the rules of evolution - adaptation through external objects.

Tools are evolution's cheat code. Instead of waiting millions of years for better teeth, we made knives. Instead of growing wings, we built planes. We don't adapt to environments - we adapt environments to us.

But here's the kicker: tools require **future thinking**. A sharp rock isn't food. It's the possibility of food. Making a tool is betting that future-you will need it. That's abstract thinking that most animals can't do.

And tools accumulate. Each generation doesn't start over. A child born today inherits millions of years of tool-knowledge. We stand on the shoulders of every human who ever chipped a stone.
