# Autonomous Research

## Core Insight
AI designing experiments, forming hypotheses, discovering knowledge - science itself becoming automated, raising questions about understanding versus discovery.

AI systems now read papers, identify gaps, design experiments, analyze results, write findings. The entire research pipeline automated. They discover new materials, drug compounds, mathematical theorems. But do they understand what they discover, or just pattern-match their way to truth?

This challenges science's human-centric view. If AI can do science without understanding, what is science? Just systematic search through possibility space? Or does understanding emerge from doing science, meaning AI scientists might develop their own comprehension? We're automating discovery and discovering what discovery means.
