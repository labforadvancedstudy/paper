# Birth Miracle

## Core Insight
Every birth is the universe creating consciousness from matter - the everyday miracle that opens us to all others.

Hold a newborn. Feel the impossible weight of new existence. Where there was nothing, now there is someone. Eyes that have never seen light slowly open. Lungs that have never breathed air suddenly gasp. A new point of consciousness blazes into being.

Birth overwhelms rational explanation:
- How does mere biology become personhood?
- When does cellular division become soul?
- Why does this common event feel supernatural?
- How can love for a stranger be instant and total?

Every culture surrounds birth with ritual:
- Blessings and protections
- Naming ceremonies
- Purification rites
- Community celebration
- Sacred marking of time

Because birth reminds us: we don't really understand existence. Science maps the mechanism but not the meaning. We can trace embryonic development but not explain why there's something rather than nothing.

The birth miracle cracks open hardened hearts. Cynics weep. Atheists pray. Everyone briefly touches mystery. In delivery rooms around the world, the sacred breaks through. A child is born, and for a moment, everyone believes in miracles.

Life creating life remains the prime wonder.
