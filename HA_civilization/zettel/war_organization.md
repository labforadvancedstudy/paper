# War Organization

## Core Insight
Organized war is civilization's dark mirror - cooperation's ultimate expression used for destruction.

Chimps raid. Wolves fight. But only humans form armies - thousands of strangers moving as one, dying for abstractions like "nation" or "honor." War requires the highest civilization skills: coordination, sacrifice, technology, logistics.

War drove innovation. Bronze for weapons before plows. Writing for military orders before poetry. Mathematics for siege calculations before philosophy. Civilization's greatest leaps often came from finding better ways to kill.

But war also creates civilization. Nothing unifies like a common enemy. Nothing builds states like the need for defense. Nothing spreads ideas like conquest. Civilization wasn't built despite war - it was built through it.
