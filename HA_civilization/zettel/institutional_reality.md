# Institutional Reality

## Core Insight
Institutions are collective hallucinations so powerful they become more real than physical reality.

A piece of paper isn't money - unless we all agree it is. A building isn't a courthouse - unless we all treat it as one. These are "social facts" - things that exist only because we believe they exist.

But try not believing. Try telling the judge "this court doesn't exist." The bailiff's very real handcuffs will convince you otherwise. Institutional reality has teeth because everyone else believes, and their belief creates consequences.

This is civilization's deepest magic: turning collective fiction into functional fact. Every institution - marriage, property, government, corporation - is a shared story that shapes behavior more powerfully than physics.
