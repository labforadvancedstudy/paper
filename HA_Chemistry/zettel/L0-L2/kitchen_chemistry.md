# Kitchen Chemistry

## Core Insight
Every kitchen is a chemistry lab - heat driving reactions, mixing creating emulsions, time allowing transformations.

Bread rises - yeast converting sugar to CO2. Eggs cook - proteins unfolding and linking. Onions brown - sugars caramelizing. Milk sours - bacteria producing acid. The kitchen demonstrates more chemistry principles than most textbooks.

Heat accelerates everything. Cold slows it down. That's why we refrigerate - to slow the chemistry of decay. Cooking is controlled decomposition, using heat to break and remake molecular bonds in delicious ways.

A child helping bake sees chemistry's time element. Mix ingredients - nothing. Wait - the dough doubles. Bake - it solidifies. Each stage is different chemistry: fermentation, gas expansion, protein denaturation, Maillard browning.
