# Chemical Bonds

## Core Insight
Atoms share or steal electrons to achieve stability - the fundamental trades that build all molecules.

Three ways atoms connect: ionic (electron theft), covalent (electron sharing), metallic (electron pooling). Each creates different properties. Salt dissolves because its ionic bonds break in water. Diamond is hard because carbon atoms share electrons in a 3D network. Metals conduct because electrons flow freely.

The octet rule drives most bonding - atoms want 8 outer electrons like noble gases. Sodium has one extra, chlorine needs one. Sodium gives, chlorine takes, both happy. Carbon needs four, shares with four hydrogens. Mutual benefit through electron economics.

Bond strength varies. Triple bonds stronger than double, double stronger than single. More shared electrons, stronger grip. Breaking bonds requires energy, forming releases it. All chemistry is electron rearrangement.
