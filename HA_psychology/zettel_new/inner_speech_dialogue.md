# Inner Speech: Self-Dialogue

**Core Concept**: We think by talking to ourselves silently, creating an internal dialogue.

## One-Line Definition
Thought is largely internalized conversation - you're always in dialogue with yourself.

## Simple Mental Model
Like having a phone call with yourself. The same brain regions active in speaking/listening activate during thinking.

## Key Mechanism
1. External speech becomes whispered
2. Whispered becomes sub-vocal
3. Sub-vocal becomes purely mental
4. Retains conversational structure

## Practical Example
Solving a math problem: "Okay, first I need to... wait, that's not right. Let me try... ah, if I move this over..." You're teaching yourself through self-talk.

## Common Misconception
Inner speech is just thoughts in words. Actually, it maintains full dialogue structure - questions, answers, even arguments with yourself.
