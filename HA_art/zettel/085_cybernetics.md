# Cybernetics

## Core Insight
Control and communication in art systems - where feedback loops create self-regulating artworks, viewers become components, and the boundary between observer and observed dissolves.

Cybernetic principles:
- Feedback central
- Goal-seeking behavior
- Self-regulation
- Information flow
- System adaptation

Cybernetic art pioneers:
- Pask's Musicolour
- Schöffer's CYSP
- Ascott's Change-Paintings
- Burnham's Software
- Reichardt's exhibition

Feedback types in art:
- Viewer response
- Environmental data
- System state
- Time cycles
- Random input

Interactive cybernetics:
- Sensors detect
- Processing decides
- Actuators respond
- Loops continue
- Behavior emerges

Second-order cybernetics:
- Observer included
- Recursion acknowledged
- Objectivity impossible
- Co-creation inevitable
- Ethics embedded

Contemporary forms:
- Responsive installations
- Bio-feedback art
- AI conversations
- Robotic performers
- Smart materials

Cybernetic aesthetics:
- Process over product
- Behavior as beauty
- Adaptation valued
- Surprise expected
- Control distributed

Critical questions:
- Agency location?
- Control illusion?
- Surveillance normalized?
- Behavior manipulated?
- Freedom programmed?

Future directions:
- Neural interfaces
- Swarm systems
- Quantum feedback
- Biological computing
- Consciousness loops

Cybernetics reveals: Art always involved feedback. Viewer changes work by viewing. Gallery affects behavior. Culture is cybernetic system. Recognition changes everything.
