# Taboo

## Core Insight
Taboos are the electric fences of the sacred - boundaries so charged that even approaching them generates fear.

Some things are so sacred or so dangerous that they must not be touched, spoken, seen, or even thought. Taboos mark these ultimate boundaries. They're not mere rules but visceral prohibitions that trigger automatic revulsion.

Taboo characteristics:
- Pre-rational power (felt before thought)
- Contagious quality (spreads by contact)
- Absolute prohibition (no exceptions)
- Severe consequences (cosmic, not just social)
- Universal yet culturally specific

Common taboo categories:
- Sacred names (unpronounceable divine)
- Body boundaries (incest, cannibalism)
- Death pollution (corpse contact)
- Menstrual/birth blood
- Sacred objects/spaces
- Forbidden knowledge

Taboos reveal deepest anxieties:
- Boundary dissolution
- Category confusion
- Power contamination
- Identity loss
- Cosmic disorder

Modern secular taboos:
- Child abuse
- Racial slurs
- Holocaust denial
- Privacy violation
- Consent breaking

The taboo paradox: By marking the absolutely forbidden, taboos create fascination. The strongest "no" generates the strongest curiosity. Every culture needs taboos, yet every taboo eventually gets broken.

Taboos are society's unconscious made conscious through prohibition.
