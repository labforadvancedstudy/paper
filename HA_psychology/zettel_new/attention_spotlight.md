# Attention Spotlight

## Core Insight
Attention is consciousness's flashlight - illuminating one thing means leaving others in darkness.

You can't attend to everything. Right now, you weren't feeling your tongue in your mouth (but now you are). Attention is the brain's brutal editor, cutting 99.9% of sensory input. It's not about what you see - it's about what you ignore. The cocktail party effect: somehow your name cuts through noise. Magicians exploit this: attention here means blindness there.
