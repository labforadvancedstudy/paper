# Level 6: The Scientists - Language Under Microscope
*When language became object of study*

> "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously." - Noam Chomsky

## The Birth of Linguistics

Geneva, 1916. Saussure's students publish his lectures posthumously. Lingua, now embodied in the scientific community, gasps collectively. Language isn't just historical evolution - it's synchronic system! 

**The revolution**:
- Langue vs. parole (system vs. speech)
- Signifier/signified (sound/meaning)
- Paradigmatic/syntagmatic (choice/chain)
- Language as formal system

Linguistics becomes science. White coats replace robes. Data replaces intuition.

## The Structuralist Revolution

Language is like chemistry:

**Not catalog of elements but**:
- Relations between elements
- Positions in system
- Oppositions and contrasts
- Minimal pairs

**Phoneme discovery**:
- /p/ and /b/ differ in one feature (voicing)
- "Pit" vs "bit" = minimal pair
- Therefore: /p/ and /b/ are separate phonemes

**The method**: 
1. Collect data
2. Find contrasts
3. Identify system
4. Describe rules

Every language dissected, structure revealed.

## The Comparative Method

Historical linguistics cracks the code:

**Sound correspondences**:
- English father = German Vater = Latin pater
- English foot = German Fuß = Latin ped-
- Pattern: English f = German v/f = Latin p

**Reconstruction**: 
Proto-Indo-European *ph₂tḗr

**The family tree**:
```
Proto-Indo-European (4000 BCE)
    ├── Germanic → English, German, Swedish
    ├── Italic → Latin → Romance languages  
    ├── Indo-Iranian → Sanskrit, Hindi, Persian
    └── 10+ other branches
```

Dead languages resurrected through living descendants.

## Grimm's Law and Sound Change

Jacob Grimm (yes, fairy tale Grimm) discovers:

**Systematic sound shifts**:
- PIE *p → Germanic f
- PIE *t → Germanic θ (th)
- PIE *k → Germanic h

**The insight**: Sound change is regular, not random. Exceptionless laws govern language change.

**Neogrammarian hypothesis**: "Sound laws admit no exceptions"

Physics envy achieved. Linguistics has laws!

## The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis

Does language shape thought?

**Strong version**: Language determines thought
- Inuit see more snow types? (Myth)
- Russians faster at blue discrimination? (True)
- Pirahã can't count? (Controversial)

**Weak version**: Language influences thought
- Spatial frames (absolute vs relative)
- Time metaphors (horizontal vs vertical)
- Gender effects on object perception

**The debate rages**: Universal cognition vs linguistic relativity.

## Chomsky's Revolution

1957: Syntactic Structures drops. Lingua explodes into new paradigm.

**Universal Grammar**:
- All humans born with language faculty
- Poverty of stimulus (kids know more than taught)
- Infinite creativity from finite input
- Deep structure vs surface structure

**The sentence that changed everything**:
"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously"
- Grammatical but meaningless
- Syntax independent of semantics
- Rules separate from meaning

**Transformational grammar**:
- Deep: [John [past] [see Mary]]
- Transform: Move auxiliary
- Surface: "Did John see Mary?"

Language isn't learned but grown. Children are programmed to program themselves linguistically.

## The Cognitive Revolution

Language meets mind science:

**Metaphor theory** (Lakoff & Johnson):
- Thought is metaphorical
- "Time is money" shapes behavior  
- "Argument is war" creates conflict
- Body grounds abstract thought

**Prototype theory**:
- Categories have fuzzy boundaries
- Robin is birdy-er than penguin
- Radial categories from center
- Classical categories fail

Language reveals cognitive architecture.

## Sociolinguistics Born

William Labov studies pronunciation in NYC department stores:

**Method**: Ask for items on different floors, note "fourth floor" pronunciation

**Findings**:
- Saks (high-end): R pronounced
- Macy's (middle): Sometimes R
- Klein's (discount): R dropped

**The principle**: Language varies systematically by:
- Social class
- Gender  
- Age
- Ethnicity
- Context

Language is social action, not abstract system.

## Corpus Linguistics

Computers enable massive data:

**Before**: Introspection and intuition
**After**: Millions of real utterances analyzed

**Discoveries**:
- Most frequent words are function words
- Collocations (words that go together)
- Register differences quantified
- Change tracked precisely

"I think" is 1000x more common than "I cogitate" - frequency matters.

## Language Universals

Greenberg examines 30 languages, finds patterns:

**Word order correlations**:
- SVO languages: prepositions
- SOV languages: postpositions
- VSO languages: prepositions

**Hierarchy patterns**:
- If dual number, then plural
- If trial number, then dual
- Marked follows unmarked

**The goal**: Find what all languages share, reveal human language capacity.

## Endangered Languages

Linguists realize: Languages dying faster than documented

**The crisis**:
- 7,000 languages exist
- 50% will die by 2100
- One dies every two weeks
- Unique worldviews lost

**Documentation race**:
- Record native speakers
- Create grammars/dictionaries
- Archive digitally
- Revitalization attempts

Each language is experiment in being human. Losing one loses data.

## Bridge to L7

MIT, 1960s. Lingua, now split between human linguists and computer scientists, faces new challenge. 

"Can machines understand language?" 

ELIZA seems to. SHRDLU moves blocks. But do they understand or simulate? Programming languages emerge - formal, unambiguous, computable.

The digital age demands new linguistics. L7 arrives in silicon.

**The Real Mystery Is...**

The more scientifically we study language, the more mysterious it becomes:
- How does child beat poverty of stimulus?
- Why does metaphor work?
- How does brain compute grammar?
- Why this design, not others?

Maybe language resists science because it enables science. The microscope can't see itself. The describable can't fully describe the describer.

"Nevertheless," says Chomsky, generating another tree diagram.

*"L6 took language apart to see how it works. Like all dissections, we learned anatomy but lost something alive. The patient survived and keeps talking."*
