# Note on v1 Dependency

All papers in v2 assume the technical framework from v1 is valid:

## From v1 (Assumed True):
1. **Abstraction Capacity Hypothesis**: Model size determines maximum abstraction level
2. **Hierarchical Knowledge Transfer**: High-level abstractions transfer efficiently  
3. **Emergence Thresholds**: New capabilities appear at discrete abstraction levels

## v2 Extensions:
- What if L9 abstraction = consciousness?
- What if brains use same principles?
- What if HA is universal?

These extensions are speculative but follow logically from v1's technical framework.

Always cite v1 papers when referencing the technical foundation.
