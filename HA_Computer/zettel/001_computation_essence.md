# Essence of Computation
## Core Insight
Computation is the universe's way of transforming information - it's not just what computers do, it's what reality does.

## What Is Computation Really?

At deepest level:
- State transformation according to rules
- Input → Process → Output
- Information changing form
- Pattern evolution

Examples everywhere:
- DNA → RNA → Protein (biological computation)
- Photon → Electron → Current (quantum computation)
- Thought → Word → Action (mental computation)
- Past → Present → Future (temporal computation)

## The Church-Turing Thesis

Any computation can be done by:
- Turing machine (theoretical)
- Lambda calculus (functional)
- Von Neumann architecture (practical)
- Quantum computer (parallel)
- Human with pencil and time (given infinite)

All equivalent in power, different in efficiency.

## Computation vs Calculation

**Calculation**: Number manipulation
**Computation**: Information transformation

Computation includes:
- Logic operations
- Pattern matching
- State evolution
- Symbol manipulation
- Emergence generation

## The Limits

What can't be computed?
- Halting problem
- True randomness
- Consciousness(?)
- Free will(?)
- The computer computing itself completely
