# Computational Chemistry

## Core Insight
We solve chemistry with computers - approximating Schrödinger's equation for systems too complex for analytical solutions, trading accuracy for feasibility.

Hartree-Fock assumes each electron moves in the average field of all others. Density Functional Theory says electron density contains all information. Coupled Cluster includes electron correlation systematically. Each method balances accuracy against computational cost.

The curse of dimensionality haunts us. Each electron adds three dimensions. Ten electrons means 30-dimensional wavefunction. Basis sets approximate infinity with finite functions. Bigger basis, better accuracy, exponentially growing cost.

Yet it works. We predict reaction barriers, design catalysts, understand enzyme mechanisms - all in silico. Chemistry becomes a computational science. The computer is the new test tube, algorithms the new reagents.
