# Limits of Growth

## Core Insight
The limits of growth is where exponential economic ambition meets finite planetary reality - an inevitable collision that defines humanity's ultimate economic challenge.

The arithmetic is brutal. Economic growth compounds. At 3% annually, the economy doubles every 23 years, quadruples in 46, grows 16-fold per century. Physical consumption can't compound forever on a finite planet. Something must give.

The 1972 "Limits to Growth" report modeled this collision. Critics attacked its specifics, but the core insight remains: exponential growth in a finite system eventually hits limits. Whether it's oil, climate capacity, or ecosystem services, infinities don't exist in physics.

Techno-optimists propose escapes. Efficiency will decouple growth from resources. We'll colonize space. Fusion will provide infinite energy. Digital economies need no materials. But efficiency has limits (Jevons paradox). Space is expensive. Fusion remains tomorrow's technology. Even digital requires energy and rare earths.

The deeper issue: growth is our economic religion. Pension systems assume it. Debt requires it. Political stability depends on it. Capitalism without growth is like Christianity without Christ - theoretically possible but fundamentally transformed.

Yet some propose post-growth economics. Steady-state systems. Circular economies. Degrowth for rich nations. Quality over quantity. But how? Every attempt crashes on political realities.

The ultimate question: can human civilization mature beyond growth or are we locked in a tragic race between expansion and collapse?
