# Abstraction

## Core Insight
Reality distilled to essence - where representation dissolves into pure form, color, and energy, revealing the forces beneath appearances.

Abstraction isn't absence but concentration. Strip away specifics, find universals:
- Geometric abstraction: world as mathematics
- Gestural abstraction: emotion as mark
- Color field: pure optical experience
- Minimalism: reduced to essentials
- Process abstraction: action visible

Journey from representation:
- Simplification (less detail)
- Stylization (characteristic emphasis)
- Fragmentation (cubist breaking)
- Dissolution (impressionist melting)
- Pure abstraction (no reference)

But "pure" abstraction impossible. Brain seeks patterns, finds faces in clouds. Titles guide reading. Context suggests meaning. Even Malevich's black square means something.

Abstraction parallels science:
- Both seek underlying patterns
- Mathematics describes invisible forces
- Particle physics abstracts matter
- Code abstracts thought
- Maps abstract territory

Cultural resistance persists:
- "My kid could do that"
- "What is it supposed to be?"
- Decoration accusation
- Elitism charges
- Market skepticism

Yet abstraction surrounds us:
- Corporate logos
- App icons
- Data visualizations
- Architectural forms
- Fashion patterns

Digital native to abstraction - pixels, vectors, algorithms. Screen space suits non-representational. Generation raised on abstract interfaces finds abstraction natural, not difficult.
