# Communication Barriers

## Core Insight
Alien communication might be so fundamentally different that first contact isn't about translation but about recognizing that communication is even being attempted.

We assume aliens will use radio, or at least electromagnetic signals. But what if they communicate through:
- Gravitational waves (we just learned to detect these)
- Quantum entanglement networks
- Neutrino beams
- Spacetime geometry manipulation
- Dark matter interactions
- Dimensions we can't perceive

Even if we share a medium, conceptual barriers loom:
- Time perception (what if they think in geological time?)
- Sensory modalities (no eyes = no visual metaphors)
- Logic structures (non-binary, non-causal)
- Social concepts (no individuals, only collectives)
- Mathematical foundations (different axioms)
- Consciousness types (distributed, quantum, field-based)

The translation problem cascades:
1. Recognize signal as artificial
2. Identify it as communication  
3. Find pattern/structure
4. Map to meaning
5. Understand context
6. Bridge conceptual gaps

Historical example: Linear A remains undeciphered and it's from humans. Alien communication might be exponentially harder. We might be swimming in alien messages right now, unrecognized.

The cosmic irony: The universe could be loud with conversation, but in languages we can't even recognize as language.

## Connections
→ [[signal_recognition]] (is this even artificial?)
→ [[conceptual_translation]] (ideas that don't map)
→ [[mediating_ai]] (machines as translators)
← [[human_assumptions]] (our biases)
← [[information_theory]] (universal principles?)
