# Division of Labor

## Core Insight
Division of labor is the first great multiplier - transforming generalists into specialists, creating efficiency through focus, making the whole exponentially greater than the sum.

Adam Smith's pin factory revealed the magic: one person making pins produces dozens daily. Ten people, each doing one step, produce thousands. The multiplication isn't just efficiency - it's transformation. Divided labor creates new possibilities.

The division runs deep. Not just "you make, I sell" but infinitely fractal: departments within companies, teams within departments, roles within teams. Each division allows deeper expertise, faster learning, better results.

But division also creates dependence. The specialist needs others to complete the whole. This mutual need weaves the organization together - creating bonds stronger than hierarchy, necessity that becomes community. We divide to multiply, separate to unite.
