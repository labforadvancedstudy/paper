# Electrons Flowing

## Core Insight
Computation is choreographed electricity - electrons dancing to the beat of the clock.

Inside every wire, a river of electrons flows. Not randomly - purposefully. Pushed by voltage, guided by resistance, switching paths at intersections made of silicon. Each electron carries a tiny bit of "yes" or "no," and billions of them together carry thoughts.

We've tricked sand into thinking by teaching electrons how to flow through it in patterns. The same force that lights bulbs and shocks fingers becomes logic when we constrain its paths carefully enough.
