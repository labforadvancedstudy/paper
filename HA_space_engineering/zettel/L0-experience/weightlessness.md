# Weightlessness

## Core Insight
Your body floating, organs shifting, mind reeling as every Earth-evolved system discovers it's been preparing for the wrong universe - the profound disorientation of falling forever without landing.

Zero-g hits different than expected. It's not like floating in water - there's no resistance, no up, no down. Your inner ear screams confusion. Your stomach floats. Your face puffs as fluids redistribute. Welcome to the environment we weren't designed for.

The immediate sensations:
- Instant nausea (50% of people)
- Face fullness (fluid shift)
- Spine extending (grow 2 inches)
- Disorientation (which way is up?)
- Euphoria or panic (varies by person)
- Clumsiness (lifetime of reflexes now wrong)

What breaks in zero-g:
- Proprioception (body position sense)
- Hand-eye coordination (overshoot everything)
- Sleep positions (no comfortable)
- Eating/drinking (liquids float away)
- Bathroom activities (don't ask)
- Crying (tears don't fall)

But also the magic:
- Effortless movement in 3D
- Sleeping in any orientation
- Perfect posture (no gravity slouch)
- Playful physics (spinning objects)
- The overview effect (seeing Earth floating)
- Dreams of flying becoming real

Adaptation takes days to weeks:
- Brain rewires spatial processing
- New movement strategies develop
- Nausea subsides (usually)
- Coordination returns (different but effective)

Weightlessness reveals how Earth-centric our bodies are. Every system assumes down exists. In space, you must relearn existence itself.
