# Habit Loops

## Core Insight
Habits are your brain's automation system - consciousness is too expensive to waste on routine.

Cue, routine, reward - this trinity runs most of your day without asking permission. Your brain literally builds highways for repeated behaviors, letting you brush teeth while planning breakfast. That's why breaking bad habits feels like demolishing infrastructure. The cue triggers, the routine runs, the reward reinforces. You can't delete highways, but you can build detours - same cue, new routine, similar reward.
