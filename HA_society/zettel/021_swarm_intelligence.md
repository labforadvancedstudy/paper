# Swarm Intelligence

Stupid units + simple rules = smart behavior.

Termites building:
1. Drop mud where mud smell strong
2. Add pheromone to mud
3. That's it

Result: Complex architecture.

No blueprint. No architect.
Order from randomness + positive feedback.

Bird flocks, fish schools: Same principle.
