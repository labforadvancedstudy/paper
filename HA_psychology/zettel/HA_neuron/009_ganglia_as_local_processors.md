# 009_ganglia_as_local_processors

## The First Computational Clusters

Ganglia represent a crucial innovation:
local processing centers that handle
specific functions without central oversight.

### Distributed Specialized Computing
- Each ganglion: a mini-brain
- Dedicated to specific body segments
- Local reflexes and responses
- Autonomous yet coordinated

### The Segmentation Strategy
Seen clearly in:
- Annelid worms: ganglion per segment
- Arthropods: specialized ganglia for limbs
- Mollusks: distributed control centers
- Each solving local problems locally

### Computational Efficiency
Why local processing matters:
- Reduced signal travel time
- Parallel processing capability
- Graceful degradation (damage resilience)
- The first modular neural architecture

### Foreshadowing the Brain
Ganglia teach us:
- Specialization improves efficiency
- Hierarchy enables complexity
- Local + global = robust systems
