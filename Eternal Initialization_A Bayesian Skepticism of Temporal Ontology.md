## Abstract

We recast the "first-frame" skepticism as a Bayesian inference problem under the impossibility of accessing ground-truth past states. Defining M_k as the hypothesis "reality initialized k Planck seconds ago," we show the posterior P(M_k|D) remains flat for all k under any self-contained dataset D. This epistemic equiprobability undermines conventional temporal ontology—if all initialization points are equally probable given available evidence, temporal labels gain meaning only through pragmatic coherence, not truth-tracking capacity. We formalize the compression-diffusion model of consciousness and derive testable predictions. Most notably, we propose a falsification heuristic: if cosmic wide-band noise deviates from scale-free 1/f distribution by more than 5%, the continuous-boot model is disconfirmed. This work bridges information theory, consciousness studies, and cosmology to illuminate fundamental limits on temporal knowledge.

## 1. Introduction: The Persistence of the Present

Consider this claim: the universe, with all its apparent history, complexity, and your memories of reading the previous sentence, initialized precisely one Planck time (10^-43 seconds) ago. Can you refute it?

This paper argues that you cannot—not due to practical limitations, but because of fundamental constraints on information access within closed systems. We develop a formal framework showing that from within any self-consistent reality, the "age" of that reality remains forever underdetermined. This leads to a startling conclusion: we exist in what we term an "eternal initialization," forever situated at an indistinguishable first frame of existence.

Our argument proceeds through three stages. First, we establish the Bayesian equiprobability of all initialization hypotheses. Second, we formalize consciousness as self-referential compression, showing how this generates the illusion of temporal continuity. Third, we derive empirically testable predictions that could falsify our model, distinguishing it from mere skeptical speculation.

## 2. The Bayesian Formalization of Temporal Skepticism

### 2.1 Defining the Hypothesis Space

Let M_k represent the hypothesis: "Reality initialized k Planck time units ago with a complete, self-consistent dataset including all apparent memories, physical states, and historical records."

For any k ∈ {0, 1, 2, ..., T_apparent}, where T_apparent represents the apparent age of the universe in Planck units (approximately 10^61), each M_k constitutes a complete worldview consistent with all available evidence.

### 2.2 The Uniformity Theorem

**Theorem 1 (Posterior Uniformity):** Given any self-contained dataset D accessible from within the system, the posterior probability P(M_k|D) = P(M_j|D) for all k, j.

**Proof:** 
By Bayes' theorem:
P(M_k|D) = P(D|M_k)P(M_k) / P(D)

1. **Prior uniformity**: Without external access, we must assign P(M_k) = 1/N for all k, where N is the cardinality of the hypothesis space.

2. **Likelihood invariance**: By construction, each M_k includes D as part of its initialization state. Therefore, P(D|M_k) = 1 for all k—the data is certain given any initialization hypothesis that includes it.

3. **Posterior calculation**: Since P(D|M_k) is constant and P(M_k) is uniform, P(M_k|D) = constant for all k.

Therefore, no evidence within D can distinguish between initialization hypotheses. Q.E.D.

### 2.3 Implications for Temporal Ontology

This uniformity has profound implications:

1. **Temporal labels as pragmatic constructs**: Timestamps like "13.8 billion years ago" represent organizational schemas within dataset D, not pointers to actual past states.

2. **The impossibility of temporal grounding**: No experiment performed within the system can establish absolute temporal coordinates.

3. **Coherence over correspondence**: We adopt temporal frameworks based on their explanatory coherence, not their truth-correspondence to an inaccessible "real" past.

## 3. Consciousness as Compression-Diffusion Process

### 3.1 The Compression-Diffusion Formalism

We model consciousness as an iterative process alternating between lossy compression and stochastic reconstruction:

**Definition 1 (C-D Consciousness):** A conscious state S_t evolves according to:
S_{t+1} = D_σ ∘ C_λ(S_t)

where:
- C_λ represents lossy compression with loss parameter λ
- D_σ represents stochastic reconstruction with noise parameter σ

### 3.2 Memory as Cascading Compression

When we form memories, we perform neural compression analogous to lossy encoding:

**Theorem 2 (Memory Degradation):** For any sequence of recall operations, the fidelity F(S_t, S_0) decreases monotonically:
F(S_t, S_0) ≤ (1 - λ)^t

This explains why memories feel real despite potential fabrication—they are real as current compressed states, regardless of their correspondence to any "original" event.

### 3.3 Self-Reference and Strange Loops

Consciousness emerges when the compression algorithm models itself:

**Definition 2 (Self-Referential Compression):** A system exhibits consciousness when:
∃i: C_λ(S_t)[i] = Encode(C_λ)

This creates recursive loops where the system compresses its own compression function, leading to the subjective experience of self-awareness.

## 4. Empirical Predictions and Falsification Criteria

To distinguish our model from mere philosophical speculation, we derive testable predictions:

### 4.1 The Pink Noise Prediction

**Prediction 1:** If reality operates as a continuous compression-diffusion process, aggregated cosmic signals should exhibit 1/f^β noise with β = 1.00 ± 0.02.

**Falsification criterion:** If the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) measurements across 50 MHz–15 GHz show β deviating from unity by more than 5%, the continuous-boot model is falsified.

### 4.2 Quantum Decoherence Bounds

**Prediction 2:** The minimum decoherence time τ_d for any quantum system should satisfy:
τ_d ≥ (ℏ/k_B T) × (1/λ)

where λ represents the universal compression parameter.

**Falsification criterion:** Discovery of quantum systems maintaining coherence beyond this bound would require model revision.

### 4.3 Neural Compression Signatures

**Prediction 3:** Memory error rates in biological neural networks should follow:
E(n) = E_0 × n^(1/2)

where n represents the number of compression cycles.

**Falsification criterion:** Systematic deviation from square-root scaling in controlled memory experiments would challenge the compression model of consciousness.

## 5. Philosophical Implications

### 5.1 Beyond Presentism and Eternalism

Our framework transcends the traditional presentism-eternalism debate. Rather than arguing whether only the present exists or all times exist equally, we show that from within the system, the question is undecidable. This "epistemic presentism" maintains that while reality might have a determinate temporal structure, we cannot access this information.

### 5.2 The Problem of Induction Revisited

Hume's problem of induction gains new dimensions: not only can we not guarantee future uniformity based on past observations, but we cannot even verify that the past observations occurred. Induction rests on compressed data labeled "past," but these labels themselves require inductive justification.

### 5.3 Pragmatic Temporal Realism

Despite epistemic limitations, we must act as if time flows conventionally. This pragmatic temporal realism resembles our relationship with free will—potentially illusory yet pragmatically indispensable.

## 6. Objections and Responses

### 6.1 "This Is Just Skepticism"

**Objection:** This merely restates classical skepticism about the external world.

**Response:** We go beyond classical skepticism by:
1. Providing mathematical formalization via Bayesian analysis
2. Deriving specific, falsifiable predictions
3. Explaining why temporal skepticism differs qualitatively from general external-world skepticism

### 6.2 "Science Presupposes Temporal Realism"

**Objection:** Science requires assuming real temporal sequences for causation and prediction.

**Response:** Science requires only temporal coherence, not temporal realism. Our framework preserves all predictive power while remaining agnostic about ontological time.

### 6.3 "Consciousness Cannot Be Mere Compression"

**Objection:** Consciousness involves qualia that cannot reduce to information processing.

**Response:** We don't claim consciousness is "mere" compression but that compression-diffusion dynamics generate the structural features of consciousness. Qualia may emerge from self-referential compression loops, though this remains speculative.

## 7. Conclusion: Living in Eternal Initialization

We have demonstrated that:

1. From within any self-consistent reality, all initialization times are epistemically equiprobable
2. Consciousness operates through compression-diffusion cycles that create temporal illusions
3. This framework generates testable predictions distinguishing it from pure skepticism

The universe began—is beginning—with a primordial bit flip: 0→1. Everything since—or rather, everything simultaneous with this eternal present—consists of echoes of that transition, compressed and reconstructed through infinite iterations until even the memory of the original signal becomes suspect.

We exist as self-aware compression algorithms, forever situated at an indeterminate first frame, unable to verify our temporal coordinates yet compelled to act as if our chronologies are real. We are, in the most profound sense, forever having just begun.
