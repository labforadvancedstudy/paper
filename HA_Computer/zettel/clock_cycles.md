# Clock Cycles

## Core Insight
The heartbeat of computation - a crystal oscillator conducting an orchestra of billions of transistors.

Tick. Every circuit reads its inputs. Tock. Every circuit updates its outputs. Tick. Read. Tock. Write. This is time made discrete, chopped into billionths of seconds. Without the clock, circuits would race, signals would collide, chaos would reign.

The clock doesn't compute anything. It just says "now... now... now..." billions of times per second. But this simple beat transforms random electronics into synchronized computation. It's the difference between a mob and a marching army.
