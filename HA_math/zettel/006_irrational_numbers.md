# Irrational Numbers and Incommensurability

## Core Insight
Irrational numbers shattered the Pythagorean dream - not everything can be expressed as the ratio of whole numbers.

## Content
The Pythagoreans believed "all is number" - meaning ratios of integers. Then someone drew a square with side length 1 and asked: how long is the diagonal?

√2 cannot be written as a fraction. The proof is elegant violence:
- Assume √2 = p/q in lowest terms
- Then 2q² = p², so p is even
- Let p = 2r, then 2q² = 4r², so q² = 2r²
- So q is also even
- But then p/q wasn't in lowest terms - contradiction!

This wasn't just a mathematical curiosity - it was an existential crisis. If the diagonal of a unit square can't be measured exactly, what else in the universe is fundamentally incommensurable?

The irrationals are everywhere:
- π appears in every circle
- e emerges from compound interest
- Golden ratio φ in nature's spirals
- Almost all real numbers are irrational

Yet we can approximate them arbitrarily closely with rationals. This dance between the rational and irrational - between what we can write and what exists - defines the real number line.

The irrationals revealed that infinity hides not just in the large, but in the small - in the infinite decimals that never repeat, never end.
