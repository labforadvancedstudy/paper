# Language Shapes Thought

**Core Concept**: The language you speak influences how you think and perceive reality.

## One-Line Definition
Your native tongue creates mental grooves that guide thought patterns.

## Simple Mental Model
Like wearing tinted glasses - language colors every thought. Russian speakers see light and dark blue as different as red and green because they have separate words.

## Key Mechanism
1. Language provides categories
2. Categories shape attention
3. Attention influences memory
4. Memory guides future thinking

## Practical Example
English speakers think of time horizontally (back/forward). Mandarin speakers think vertically (up/down). This affects how they gesture, remember events, and plan futures.

## Common Misconception
Language determines thought absolutely. Actually, it influences and biases - you can think beyond your language, it's just harder.
