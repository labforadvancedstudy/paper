# Simulacra

## Core Insight
When copies become more real than originals - society living in a map that has replaced the territory.

Baudrillard's vertigo: we've moved from representing reality to simulating it to replacing it. Instagram shows lives that don't exist. News covers events created for coverage. Brands sell identities. The simulation has become our habitat.

Consider money's evolution: representing gold → backed by government → pure information. Or identity: reflecting inner self → performing roles → curating feeds. The trajectory is always toward pure simulation.

In the simulacra, authenticity becomes another performance. "Being real" is a style. Rebellion is a market segment. Even critiquing simulation happens within simulation. We're in a reality that references only itself, a dream unsure it's dreaming.
