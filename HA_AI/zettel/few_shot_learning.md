# Few Shot Learning

## Core Insight
AI learning from handful of examples like humans do - breaking the assumption that intelligence requires big data, approaching human-like learning efficiency.

Show a child three pictures of zebras and they recognize zebras forever. Traditional AI needed thousands. Few-shot learning changes that: AI learning new concepts from minimal examples by leveraging prior knowledge. It doesn't learn from scratch but builds on learned representations.

This shifts the paradigm from data-hungry to knowledge-efficient learning. The AI has learned how to learn - meta-patterns that transfer across tasks. Like humans using analogy and abstraction, AI learns to extract maximum information from minimum examples. We're approaching sample efficiency that matches biology.
