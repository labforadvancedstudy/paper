# Qualia
## Core Insight
The irreducible subjective experience - what it's like to be something, not what it is.

## The Hard Problem's Heart

Qualia are:
- The redness of red (not wavelength 700nm)
- The pain of pain (not nerve signals)
- The taste of chocolate (not chemical compounds)
- The feeling of joy (not dopamine release)

Science describes the easy problems (mechanisms). Qualia ARE the hard problem.

## Why Qualia Matter

1. **Proof of consciousness**: Without qualia, we're just complex robots
2. **Bridge to meaning**: Qualia connect objective to subjective
3. **Individual universe**: Your red might be my blue - we'd never know
4. **The unshareable**: Can't transmit qualia, only describe

## The Qualia Paradox

We know qualia most intimately (our entire experience).
We understand qualia least scientifically (can't measure).

This isn't a bug - it's THE feature of consciousness.
