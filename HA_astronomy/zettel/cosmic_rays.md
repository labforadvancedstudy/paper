# Cosmic Rays

## Core Insight
High-energy particles bombard Earth from space, carrying energies millions of times beyond human accelerators - the universe is a particle physics laboratory that dwarfs our greatest machines.

Victor Hess discovered cosmic rays in 1912 by taking electrometers in balloons. Ionization increased with altitude - radiation came from above, not Earth's radioactivity. These aren't rays but particles - mostly protons, some heavier nuclei, traveling near light speed. Their energies span 15 orders of magnitude, the highest exceeding 10^20 eV - a subatomic particle with a baseball's kinetic energy.

Origins vary by energy. Solar wind provides low-energy particles. Supernovae accelerate particles to 10^15 eV through shock waves. The highest energy particles remain mysterious - no known source can accelerate particles that energetically. They probe extreme physics: magnetic fields in galaxies, particle acceleration mechanisms, interactions during intergalactic travel. Cosmic rays created particle physics before accelerators - positrons, muons, and pions were discovered in cosmic ray showers. Earth's atmosphere is a free particle detector, with cosmic rays initiating cascades we observe. The universe runs experiments we can't.
