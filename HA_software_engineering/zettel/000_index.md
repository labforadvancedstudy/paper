## Original High-Level Concepts (001-009)
*These provide practical perspectives complementing the newer philosophical zettels*

- [[001_software_essence]] - Crystallized human thought
- [[002_abstraction_art]] - Finding right levels (practical patterns, see also 014)
- [[003_technical_debt]] - Conscious trade-offs (practical view, see also 050)
- [[004_testing_philosophy]] - Building confidence (practical approach, see also 023)
- [[005_emergent_architecture]] - Evolution over planning (see also 022)
- [[006_code_as_communication]] - Humans first (practical principles, see also 054)
- [[007_distributed_systems]] - Complexity for scale (technical patterns, see also 040)
- [[008_software_evolution]] - Adaptation over time (practical lifecycle, see also 063)
- [[009_engineering_wisdom]] - Hard-won truths

## Cross-References and Relationships

### Complementary Pairs
Several concepts have both practical and philosophical treatments:
- **Abstraction**: 002 (practical) ↔ 014 (philosophical)
- **Technical Debt**: 003 (management) ↔ 050 (commentary)
- **Testing**: 004 (strategies) ↔ 023 (abstract)
- **Architecture**: 005 (emergent) ↔ 022 (principles)
- **Communication**: 006 (practical) ↔ 054 (language theory)
- **Distributed Systems**: 007 (technical) ↔ 040 (metaphorical)
- **Evolution**: 008 (lifecycle) ↔ 063 (philosophical)

## Key Insights
1. Code is language - we teach sand to think through words
2. Complexity is inevitable - entropy always wins
3. Abstraction is power - but every layer has a cost
4. Systems emerge behaviors - the whole exceeds the sum
5. Technical debt is physics - pay now or pay more later
6. Performance is perception - fast is relative
7. Security is impossible - we just raise the bar
8. Distribution is hard - CAP theorem always applies
9. Everything decays - software entropy is real
10. Humans are the constant - code is for people
