# Banks

## Core Insight
Banks are trust crystallization chambers - institutions that transform individual savings into collective power, turning idle money into active force through the alchemy of fractional reserve.

A bank is fundamentally a time machine for money. It takes deposits from those who have money now but need it later, and loans it to those who need money now but will have it later. The genius is that the same money exists in multiple times simultaneously - in your savings account AND in someone else's business loan.

The magic and madness of banking:
- Fractional reserve: lending money that doesn't fully exist
- Money multiplication: $100 becomes $1000 in the system
- Interest rate spread: the bank's oxygen
- Trust cascade: one failure can topple many
- Too big to fail: when institutions become infrastructure

Banks don't store money like warehouses store goods. They're more like airports for money - facilitating movement, charging for the service, occasionally losing luggage. Modern economy is impossible without them, yet they're built on the consensual hallucination that not everyone will want their money back at once.
