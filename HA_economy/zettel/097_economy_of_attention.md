# Economy of Attention

## Core Insight
In the information age, attention becomes the scarcest resource - creating an economy where capturing minds matters more than moving matter.

Herbert Simon saw it first: information consumes attention. In a world of infinite information, attention becomes finite resource. Every notification, ad, article, video competes for your mind's limited bandwidth. The economy reorganizes around this new scarcity.

The attention merchants emerged. Google sells your searches. Facebook sells your connections. TikTok sells your dopamine. They give away services to harvest attention, then auction it to advertisers. You are the product being sold.

But it's deeper than advertising. The entire economy shifts from producing things to producing experiences that capture attention. Movies, games, social media, news - all competing in the colosseum of consciousness. The victory condition isn't satisfaction but addiction.

This creates perverse dynamics. Outrage captures attention better than insight. Clickbait beats literature. Infinite scroll defeats deep thought. We're strip-mining human consciousness for profit, leaving behind anxiety, ADHD, and existential emptiness.

Yet attention economy also democratizes. Anyone can capture global attention from their bedroom. Creators bypass gatekeepers. Niche communities flourish. Attention flows to value, sometimes.

The question becomes: how do we design an attention economy that serves human flourishing? Can we create business models that profit from focused attention rather than fractured distraction? Or are we doomed to cognitive strip-mining until the last mind breaks?
