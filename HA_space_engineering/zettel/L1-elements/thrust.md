# Thrust

## Core Insight
Newton's third law made useful - throw mass one way, go the other way, with the violence of the throwing determining how fast you accelerate.

Thrust is the fundamental currency of space travel. Without it, you're a drifting can. With it, you can change orbits, escape gravity wells, and reach other worlds. It's the pushing force that rockets generate by throwing hot gas out their nozzles at tremendous speeds.

The rocket equation rules everything:
- More exhaust velocity = more efficient thrust
- More propellant = more total thrust (but diminishing returns)
- Every gram of spacecraft needs thrust to move it
- Thrust must overcome gravity to leave Earth

Types of thrust reveal engineering priorities:
- Chemical: High thrust, low efficiency (for leaving Earth)
- Ion: Low thrust, high efficiency (for deep space)
- Nuclear: Medium thrust, medium efficiency (for cargo)
- Solar sail: Tiny thrust, infinite efficiency (for patience)

The cruel irony: you need thrust to carry the fuel that provides thrust. This recursive problem shapes all spacecraft design. Want to go faster? Carry more fuel. But more fuel needs more thrust to move it. The tyranny of the rocket equation.

In space, thrust is freedom. Without it, orbits are prisons.
