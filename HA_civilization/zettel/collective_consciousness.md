# Collective Consciousness

## Core Insight
Civilization is what happens when separate minds start functioning as neurons in a larger mind.

A termite colony builds cathedrals no single termite understands. Humans do the same. No one person knows how to build a smartphone, but humanity does. The knowledge is distributed across millions of brains.

But it goes deeper. Stock markets think. Cities dream. The internet is growing synapses. We're not just sharing information - we're creating information processing systems larger than any individual consciousness.

The question isn't whether collective consciousness exists - it's whether we're already living inside one. Are you thinking your thoughts, or is civilization thinking through you?
