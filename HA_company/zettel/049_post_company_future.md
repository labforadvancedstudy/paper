# Post Company Future

## Core Insight
The company form might be transitional - a stepping stone between individual action and something unimaginable, just as companies were unimaginable to hunter-gatherers.

What comes after companies? Network organizations dissolve boundaries. DAOs eliminate management. AI enables coordination without hierarchy. Blockchain enables trust without institutions. The building blocks of post-company organization emerge.

Perhaps future organization will be fluid - individuals assembling temporarily for projects, dissolving upon completion. Or perhaps consciousness-based - direct mind-to-mind coordination without corporate mediation. Or something we can't conceive, as incomprehensible as corporations to prehistoric humans.

But maybe asking "what comes after companies?" is like asking "what comes after life?" The form evolves but the function persists. Whatever follows will still coordinate human action, transform resources, bind time. The company might be immortal as pattern, even as instances transform.
