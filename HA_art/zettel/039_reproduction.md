# Reproduction

## Core Insight
The aura problem - how mechanical multiplication transforms unique objects into distributed experiences, democratizing access while raising questions of authenticity and value.

Benjamin warned: reproduction destroys aura. The here-and-now presence, the original's magic, lost in copies. Yet reproduction also liberates:
- Art escapes elite spaces
- Global access enabled
- Education democratized
- Influence multiplies
- Ideas spread faster

Reproduction technologies evolve:
- Woodblock: first multiples
- Printing press: image distribution
- Photography: mechanical copying
- Digital: perfect clones
- NFT: artificial scarcity return

Each technology changes seeing:
- Prints let comparison
- Photos reveal details
- Screens backlight art
- VR simulates presence
- AI generates variations

Paradoxes multiply:
- Mona Lisa known through reproductions
- Reproductions become originals (Warhol)
- Some art exists only as reproduction
- Digital files: original or copy?
- Screenshots of NFTs

Markets adapt strangely:
- Limited editions create scarcity
- Artist proofs add value
- Vintage prints premium
- Certificates authenticate
- Blockchain "proves" originality

Contemporary condition: reproduction default. Everything immediately copied, shared, remixed. "Original" becomes anachronistic concept. Yet hunger for authenticity intensifies. Live performance booms. Physical galleries persist. Hand-made premium rises.
