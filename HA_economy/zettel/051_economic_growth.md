# Economic Growth

## Core Insight
The compounding miracle: how economies escape subsistence and create exponential abundance - humanity's flight from poverty.

Economic growth is humanity's recent invention. For millennia, children lived like parents. Then something sparked - sustained increases in output per person. The hockey stick of human welfare.

Growth sources:
- **Capital accumulation** - more tools, buildings, infrastructure
- **Technology** - better ways of doing
- **Human capital** - education, skills, health
- **Institutions** - rules that encourage production
- **Innovation** - new products, processes, ideas

Growth mathematics:
- 2% annual = doubling every 35 years
- Small differences compound enormously
- Growth on growth (exponential)
- Distribution matters as much as magnitude
- Sustainability questions loom

The profound transformation: growth changed everything. Politics shifted from dividing fixed pie to growing it. Progress became expected. Future became better than past.

Yet growth has shadows - environmental destruction, inequality, meaninglessness amid plenty. The question shifts from "how to grow?" to "growth for what?" Infinite growth meets finite planet.
