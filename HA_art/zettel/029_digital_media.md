# Digital Media

## Core Insight
Code as clay - where algorithms shape light into experience, creating art from pure information, native to screens yet yearning for physical presence.

Digital media isn't digitized traditional media. It's born digital, thinking in:
- Pixels not pigments
- Algorithms not gestures
- Interaction not observation
- Networks not galleries
- Updates not permanence

Core digital properties:
- Reproducibility without degradation
- Interactivity as default
- Variability through parameters
- Connectivity enabling collaboration
- Immateriality questioning ownership

Forms proliferate:
- Generative art: code creating infinite variations
- Net art: browser as gallery
- Game art: play as aesthetic experience  
- VR/AR: reality layers multiplied
- AI art: machine learning as collaborator
- NFTs: artificial scarcity imposed

Digital natives think differently:
- Ctrl+Z changes risk relationship
- Layers enable endless revision
- Copy/paste as creative method
- Glitch as aesthetic choice
- Compression artifacts as style

Physical/digital divide blurs:
- Projection mapping on buildings
- Arduino activating sculptures
- 3D printing digital forms
- Screens in gallery spaces
- QR codes linking layers

Preservation panic: formats die, links rot, hardware obsolesces. Digital art might be most ephemeral despite seeming permanent. Museums struggle: how to collect websites? Preserve interactivity? Show networked art?
