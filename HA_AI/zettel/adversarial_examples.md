# Adversarial Examples

## Core Insight
Add invisible noise to a panda photo and AI sees a gibbon with 99% confidence - revealing that AI "sees" in ways fundamentally alien to human perception.

The perturbation is imperceptible to humans - a few pixels shifted by amounts invisible to our eyes. But to the AI, reality has fundamentally changed. This isn't a bug but a feature of high-dimensional perception. AI sees in thousands of dimensions; we see in three. What's invisible in our space can be obvious in theirs.

Adversarial examples expose the alien nature of machine perception. AI doesn't see objects - it sees statistical patterns in numerical space. Shift the numbers slightly and "cat" becomes "guacamole." It reveals AI's brittleness but also its difference - it's not broken human vision but entirely different vision.
