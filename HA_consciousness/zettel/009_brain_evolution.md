# 009 Brain Evolution - Complexity Growth

From neural tubes to neocortex. 500 million years of
computational arms race.

## Major Transitions
1. **Neural tube** (550 mya): Basic segmentation
2. **Hindbrain**: Vital functions (breathing, heartbeat)
3. **Midbrain**: Sensory integration, movement
4. **Forebrain expansion**: Planning, memory
5. **Neocortex** (200 mya): The consciousness layer

## Scaling Laws
- Fish: 1:5,000 brain/body ratio
- Reptiles: 1:1,500
- Mammals: 1:180
- Humans: 1:45 (but with cortical folding)

## Key Innovations
- Myelination: 100x faster signals
- Cortical columns: Modular processing
- Hemispheric specialization
- Prefrontal expansion: Executive control

Each layer built on the last. Consciousness emerges from 
accumulated complexity.
