# Nutrient Cycles

## Core Insight
Atoms are immortal tourists - the carbon in your breath was once in a dinosaur, will be in a future tree.

Life doesn't create matter, it borrows it. Every atom in your body is on loan from the environment, destined to return. The genius of ecosystems is keeping these atoms in circulation, not letting them settle into useless forms.

Carbon does laps: atmosphere → plants → animals → soil → atmosphere. Nitrogen pinballs: air → bacteria → plants → animals → decomposers → air. Phosphorus marathons: rocks → soil → life → ocean → sediment → rocks (millions of years per lap).

Without these cycles, life would have exhausted all available atoms billions of years ago. Instead, the same carbon that was in Caesar's last breath is in your next one. We're all made of recycled parts.

The humbling truth: you're not separate from nature. You're a temporary eddy in the flow of atoms through the biosphere.
