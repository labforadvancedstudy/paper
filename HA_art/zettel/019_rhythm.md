# Rhythm

## Core Insight
Visual beats and intervals - rhythm makes still images pulse with implied movement, teaching the eye to dance across surfaces.

Rhythm isn't just repetition. It's repetition with variation:
- Regular rhythm: same interval (fence posts, tiles)
- Alternating rhythm: A-B-A-B pattern
- Progressive rhythm: gradual change
- Flowing rhythm: organic movement
- Random rhythm: controlled chaos

Visual rhythm creates through:
- Repeating shapes
- Color intervals
- Line directions
- Texture patterns
- Value changes
- Spatial gaps

Like music, visual rhythm has tempo. Quick staccato marks create energy. Long flowing lines create calm. Artists control viewing speed through rhythm manipulation.

Nature teaches rhythm:
- Waves breaking
- Leaves on branches
- Zebra stripes
- Sand ripples
- Heartbeats
- Breathing

Artists abstract these natural rhythms. Van Gogh's swirling skies. Hokusai's wave patterns. They understood: rhythm is life force made visible.

Breaking rhythm creates emphasis. The red apple among green ones. The vertical line among horizontals. Disruption draws eye like wrong note in song.

Digital art can animate rhythm literally. But static rhythm often stronger - it lives in viewer's mind, not screen. Eye completes the movement, making viewer active participant.

Without rhythm, compositions die. Even chaos needs rhythm - Jackson Pollock's drips follow gesture rhythms, arm arcs, body dance.
