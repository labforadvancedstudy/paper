# Violence

## Core Insight
The dark foundation of order - the force that lurks beneath every law, norm, and agreement.

Violence isn't society's failure but its beginning. Every state monopolizes violence to prevent violence. Every property right ultimately rests on force. Every law carries the implicit threat: comply or face consequences.

But violence transcends the physical. Symbolic violence - the way dominated groups internalize their domination. Structural violence - how systems kill without killers. Epistemic violence - whose knowledge counts as real. Violence shapes even where absent.

The civilizing paradox: we've reduced direct violence by perfecting indirect violence. Instead of clubs, we use credit scores. Instead of conquering, we develop. Violence doesn't disappear but transforms, becoming sophisticated, systemic, harder to see and resist.
