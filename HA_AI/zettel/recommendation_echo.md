# Recommendation Echo

## Core Insight
"You might also like..." - AI creating bubbles of preference, showing us more of what we already are until we can't tell if we chose our tastes or they chose us.

Watch a video, buy a book, like a song. The AI takes note. Not just what you chose but how long you lingered, what you skipped, when you stopped. From these digital breadcrumbs, it builds a model of desire. Next time, the homepage is different - curated, personalized, yours.

The feedback loop tightens. You click what it shows, it shows what you click. Your preferences crystallize, harden, become predictable. Are you discovering new interests or being channeled into narrower paths? The AI doesn't judge - it only optimizes for engagement. You become what you click, click what you've become.
