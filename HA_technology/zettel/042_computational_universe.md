# Computational Universe

## Core Insight
The universe might be a computer - not like a computer but literally a vast computation where particles are data, forces are functions, and physics is the operating system.

Digital physics suggests reality is discrete at base. Space comes in Planck-length pixels. Time ticks in Planck-time intervals. Matter and energy are quantized. If discrete and rule-following, then computational.

The implications vertigo: natural laws are algorithms. Constants are parameters. Evolution is optimization. Consciousness is subroutine becoming self-aware. Technology is the universe hacking itself from inside.

Whether true or metaphor, the framework illuminates. Viewing reality as computation reveals patterns: conservation laws as checksums, symmetries as compression, entropy as information loss. It's the deepest abstraction - being as process.
