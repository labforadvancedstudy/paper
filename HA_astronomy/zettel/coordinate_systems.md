# Coordinate Systems

## Core Insight
To share celestial discoveries, astronomers invented universal addressing systems - transforming "that bright star over there" into precise coordinates that work from anywhere on Earth.

The celestial sphere is humanity's oldest abstraction - imagining stars painted on a giant sphere rotating around Earth. Though physically wrong, it's mathematically useful. Right ascension and declination create a coordinate grid projected on this sphere, like longitude and latitude on Earth. Declination measures angle from celestial equator. Right ascension measures angle from the vernal equinox, in hours (24h = 360°) because the sky rotates.

But coordinates aren't simple. Precession shifts the grid over centuries. Proper motion moves stars. Earth's orbit creates parallax. Different coordinate systems serve different needs: equatorial for telescopes, ecliptic for planets, galactic for Milky Way studies. Converting between systems requires spherical trigonometry. What seems like bookkeeping enables global collaboration. When Chinese astronomers recorded a "guest star" in 1054, modern astronomers knew exactly where to find the Crab Nebula. Universal addressing made astronomy a global enterprise.
