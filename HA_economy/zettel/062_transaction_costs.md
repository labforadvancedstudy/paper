# Transaction Costs

## Core Insight
Transaction costs are the economic friction that explains why the world isn't one giant market - why we have firms, contracts, and institutions instead of just prices.

Ronald Coase asked a simple question that revolutionized economics: if markets are so efficient, why do firms exist? Why doesn't everyone just contract for everything? His answer: because using the market has costs.

Finding the right supplier, negotiating terms, writing contracts, monitoring performance, enforcing agreements - all these create friction. Sometimes it's cheaper to bring activities inside a firm where you can just order people around.

This explains organizational boundaries. Make-or-buy decisions aren't just about production costs but transaction costs. Vertical integration happens when market friction exceeds bureaucratic friction. Outsourcing happens when the reverse is true.

But it goes deeper. Transaction costs explain why institutions exist. Property rights reduce the cost of knowing who owns what. Money reduces the cost of exchange. Courts reduce the cost of enforcement. Reputation systems reduce the cost of trust.

The internet promised to slash transaction costs to zero - perfect information, instant communication, frictionless exchange. Instead, we got new intermediaries (Amazon, Uber) who profit from reducing specific transaction costs while potentially creating others.

Transaction costs are why the economic ideal of perfect competition remains fantasy. Reality is sticky, and that stickiness shapes everything.
