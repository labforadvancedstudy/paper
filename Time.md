## Abstract
The subjective experience of time is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Existing models of time perception provide insights into the neural and cognitive bases of temporal processing but have limitations in accounting for the wide range of individual differences in subjective time experience. In this paper, we propose a novel theory, the "Brain Time Theory," which suggests that individual differences in subjective time experience can be explained by the unique information processing speed of each person's brain. We argue that the human brain experiences time differently from physical time as defined by relativity theory, and that the speed of information processing in the brain determines the subjective flow of time. Drawing upon insights from cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence, we propose a series of testable predictions and empirical tests of the theory using behavioral, neuroimaging, and computational modeling approaches. The Brain Time Theory offers a novel perspective on the nature of subjective time experience and highlights the importance of interdisciplinary research in unraveling the mysteries of human cognition. It has implications for understanding individual differences in cognition, mental health, and the development of artificial intelligence systems. The theory may foster interdisciplinary communication and collaboration, deepening our understanding of the complex interactions between time, cognition, and the brain.

## 1. Introduction
The passage of time is a fundamental aspect of human experience, yet the factors that shape our subjective perception of time remain elusive. While physics has made remarkable progress in understanding the nature of time at the cosmic scale, the psychological mechanisms underlying the subjective flow of time are still poorly understood (Grondin, 2010). Why does time seem to fly when we are having fun, but drag on endlessly when we are bored or anxious? How do individuals differ in their experience of time, and what neural and cognitive factors contribute to these differences?

To address these questions, we propose a novel theory, the "Brain Time Theory," which posits that the subjective experience of time is determined by the speed of information processing in the brain. This theory suggests that brain time, as experienced by an individual, flows at a different rate from physical time as defined by relativity theory. It's crucial to note that Brain Time Theory does not propose the existence of a specific time perception function in the brain, but rather suggests that the experience of time's flow varies according to the brain's information processing speed.

Brain Time changes throughout an individual's development and differs from person to person. For instance, a child's brain time might be experienced as flowing more slowly than an adult's. This is related to the speed at which new information is processed, with a child's brain typically processing new information more rapidly.

Furthermore, we propose that the essence of what we perceive as intelligence is rooted in these individual differences in brain time. Individuals with higher cognitive abilities, whom we refer to as "alpha individuals," possess faster neural information processing speeds, allowing them to process more information within the same physical time frame. These alpha individuals may experience time as passing more slowly compared to the average population. The concept of alpha individuals is not meant to imply a fixed or hierarchical categorization, but rather to describe those who consistently demonstrate superior cognitive performance across various domains.

The Brain Time Theory draws upon recent developments in cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence to offer a new perspective on the nature of subjective time experience. In particular, we propose that the human brain operates in a manner similar to large language models (LLMs), a class of artificial neural networks that have achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of natural language processing tasks (Brown et al., 2020). LLMs learn to process and generate language by optimizing their network architecture and connection weights based on vast amounts of training data, in a way that mirrors the optimization of neural circuits in the brain through experience-dependent plasticity.

We argue that individual differences in subjective time experience may arise from variation in the architectural and physiological parameters of neural networks in the brain, such as the speed and synchronization of neural oscillations, the efficiency of synaptic transmission, and the topology of functional connectivity patterns. These neural parameters are thought to be influenced by a range of factors, including genetics, development, experience, and neurochemical modulation, which may contribute to the wide diversity of subjective time experiences observed across individuals and cultures.

The Brain Time Theory has important implications for our understanding of the neural basis of cognition, as well as for the development of artificial intelligence systems that can model and simulate human-like cognitive processes. By proposing a link between neural information processing speed and subjective time experience, the theory offers a new framework for investigating the neural correlates of individual differences in cognition, from intelligence and creativity to psychopathology and neurodevelopmental disorders. Furthermore, the theory suggests that designing AI systems with human-like cognitive architectures and processing speeds may be crucial for replicating the subjective experiences and flexible problem-solving abilities of human intelligence.

In this paper, we first review the current state of knowledge on the neural and cognitive bases of time perception, highlighting the limitations of existing models and the need for a new theoretical framework. We then introduce the Brain Time Theory and discuss its key ideas and predictions, drawing upon relevant findings from cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. Next, we propose a series of empirical tests of the theory using behavioral, neuroimaging, and computational modeling approaches. Finally, we discuss the implications of the theory for our understanding of human cognition and the development of artificial intelligence, and outline future directions for research.

## 2. Neural and Cognitive Bases of Time Perception
### 2.1. Models of Time Perception
Current models of time perception can be broadly divided into two classes: dedicated and intrinsic models (Ivry & Schlerf, 2008). Dedicated models propose that time is processed by specialized neural circuits or modules that are distinct from those involved in other cognitive functions. The most influential dedicated model is the pacemaker-accumulator model (Treisman, 1963), which posits that a central pacemaker emits pulses at a regular rate, which are counted by an accumulator and compared to stored representations of time intervals in memory. The speed of the pacemaker is thought to be modulated by factors such as attention, arousal, and dopaminergic signaling, which can alter the subjective experience of time (Zakay & Block, 1995).

Another prominent dedicated model is the attentional-gate model (Zakay & Block, 1995), which emphasizes the role of attention in time perception. This model proposes that the accumulation of pacemaker pulses is regulated by an attentional gate, which opens wider when more attention is allocated to time, allowing more pulses to be counted. The attentional-gate model has been extended to a three-dimensional model (Zakay, 2014) that incorporates the effects of arousal and cognitive load on time perception.

In contrast, intrinsic models propose that time is an inherent property of neural dynamics and is processed by the same neural circuits that mediate other cognitive functions (Karmarkar & Buonomano, 2007). For example, the state-dependent network model (Buonomano & Maass, 2009) suggests that time is encoded in the evolving spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity within recurrent neural networks, without the need for dedicated timing mechanisms. Similarly, the striatal beat frequency model (Matell & Meck, 2004) proposes that time is encoded by the coincidence detection of oscillatory activity in cortico-striatal circuits, with different intervals represented by distinct patterns of neural synchronization.

While these models have provided valuable insights into the neural and cognitive mechanisms of time perception, they have limitations in explaining the wide range of individual differences in subjective time experience. Dedicated models struggle to account for the influence of non-temporal factors such as attention, emotion, and context on time perception, while intrinsic models lack a clear explanation for the precise quantification and comparison of time intervals. Moreover, neither class of models provides a satisfactory account of the striking variability in subjective time experience across individuals and cultures, or the neural basis of this variability.

The Brain Time Theory offers a novel perspective that addresses some of these limitations. Unlike dedicated models, it proposes that time perception is an emergent property of the general speed and efficiency of neural information processing, rather than the product of specialized timing circuits. This allows the theory to naturally account for the influence of non-temporal factors on time perception, as these factors can modulate the overall state of neural activity and thus the subjective flow of time.

Compared to intrinsic models, the Brain Time Theory provides a more explicit and quantitative link between neural dynamics and the subjective experience of time. By positing that individual differences in subjective time perception arise from individual differences in neural processing speed and efficiency, the theory offers a clear and testable explanation for the wide variability in temporal experience across individuals and cultures. Furthermore, the proposed correspondence between neural and subjective time scales allows for the precise quantification and comparison of temporal intervals, addressing a key limitation of intrinsic models.

The Brain Time Theory also offers a fresh perspective on several temporal phenomena that have been challenging to explain with existing models. For example, the subjective expansion of time during threatening or emotionally salient events (Stetson et al., 2007) can be readily accounted for by the accelerated neural processing that accompanies heightened arousal and attention in these situations. Similarly, the subjective compression of time during repetitive or predictable stimulation (Pariyadath & Eagleman, 2007) can be explained by the increased efficiency and reduced processing demands of neural responses to expected inputs.

In summary, while the Brain Time Theory shares some features with existing models of time perception, it offers a distinctive and integrative framework that addresses key limitations of dedicated and intrinsic models. By grounding time perception in the general speed and efficiency of neural information processing, the theory provides a parsimonious and testable account of the variability and malleability of subjective time experience, as well as its relation to other cognitive processes. Empirical investigations of the Brain Time Theory may therefore lead to novel insights and a more comprehensive understanding of the neural basis of time perception.

### 2.2. Neural Substrates of Time Perception
Neuroimaging and lesion studies have implicated a distributed network of brain regions in time perception, including the prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and hippocampus (Merchant et al., 2013). The prefrontal cortex, particularly the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, has been consistently activated in fMRI studies of time perception and is thought to play a key role in attentional modulation and working memory for time intervals (Lewis & Miall, 2006). The parietal cortex, especially the right inferior parietal lobe, has been implicated in the integration of temporal and spatial information and the representation of temporal magnitudes (Bueti & Walsh, 2009).

The basal ganglia, particularly the striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta, have been proposed to play a central role in time perception by providing a dopaminergic pacemaker signal that regulates the speed of neural oscillations and the flow of subjective time (Buhusi & Meck, 2005). Parkinson's disease, which is characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, is associated with impairments in time perception and reproduction (Harrington et al., 2011). The cerebellum has been implicated in the precise timing of short intervals in the millisecond range, as well as in the coordination of motor and perceptual timing (Ivry & Spencer, 2004).

At the cellular level, time perception has been linked to the dynamics of neural oscillations and the synchronization of neural activity across different frequency bands (Gu et al., 2015). For example, the striatal beat frequency model proposes that time intervals are encoded by the coincidence detection of oscillatory activity in cortico-striatal circuits, with different intervals represented by distinct patterns of neural synchronization (Matell & Meck, 2004). Similarly, the temporal scaling model suggests that time is encoded by the scaling of neural oscillations in the alpha and beta frequency ranges, with longer intervals associated with slower oscillations and shorter intervals with faster oscillations (Klimesch, 2012).

Despite these advances, the neural mechanisms underlying individual differences in subjective time experience remain poorly understood. While some studies have reported associations between individual differences in time perception and neural activity in regions such as the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia (Wiener et al., 2010), the specific neural parameters that give rise to these differences have not been clearly identified. Moreover, the neural basis of the wide cultural diversity in time experience, such as the tendency for some cultures to have a more relaxed and flexible attitude towards time compared to others (Levine, 1997), has not been systematically investigated.

## 3. The Brain Time Theory
### 3.1. Neural Information Processing Speed and Brain Time Experience
The Brain Time Theory proposes that the subjective experience of time is determined by the speed of information processing in the brain. Specifically, we suggest that each individual's brain has a unique "processing speed" that governs the rate at which neural computations are performed, analogous to the clock frequency of a computer processor. This processing speed is hypothesized to be a function of the temporal dynamics of neural activity, such as the frequency and synchronization of neural oscillations, as well as the efficiency of synaptic transmission and the topology of functional connectivity patterns.

Individual differences in brain processing speed are proposed to arise from a combination of genetic, developmental, and experiential factors that shape the temporal dynamics of neural activity. For example, genetic variations in ion channel function, neurotransmitter signaling, and synaptic plasticity may contribute to individual differences in neural oscillations and information processing speed (Meck et al., 2008). Developmental factors such as early sensory experience and critical period plasticity may also play a role in shaping the temporal dynamics of neural circuits (Buonomano & Maass, 2009). Moreover, experience-dependent plasticity throughout the lifespan may continue to modify the speed and efficiency of neural information processing, as evidenced by the effects of learning and expertise on temporal processing (Matthews & Meck, 2016).


The brain clock hypothesis makes several key predictions about the relationship between neural information processing speed and subjective time experience. First, individuals with faster brain clocks are predicted to experience time as passing more slowly, as they can process more information within a given interval. This may manifest as a greater ability to make fine-grained temporal discriminations, a more accurate perception of time intervals, and a more vivid and detailed experience of the present moment. In contrast, individuals with slower brain clocks may experience time as passing more quickly, as they process less information within a given interval, leading to a more coarse-grained and less detailed perception of time.

Second, the brain clock hypothesis predicts that subjective time experience should be malleable and dependent on the current state of neural activity. Factors that alter the speed and efficiency of neural information processing, such as attention, arousal, and neurochemical modulation, are expected to influence the subjective flow of time. For example, states of heightened attention and arousal, such as those induced by sudden threats or novel stimuli, may accelerate neural processing and produce a subjective slowing of time (Stetson et al., 2007). Conversely, states of low arousal and inattention, such as those associated with boredom or fatigue, may slow neural processing and produce a subjective speeding of time (Zakay, 2014).

Third, the brain clock hypothesis predicts that individual differences in subjective time experience should be associated with individual differences in cognitive abilities that depend on the speed and efficiency of neural information processing. For example, individuals with faster brain clocks may exhibit superior performance on tasks that require rapid temporal processing, such as musical rhythm perception (Rammsayer & Altenmüller, 2006), speech perception (Tallal et al., 1993), and visual motion detection (Mather et al., 2013). Moreover, individual differences in brain clock speed may contribute to individual differences in higher-order cognitive abilities such as working memory, executive function, and fluid intelligence, which rely on the rapid and efficient processing of information in neural circuits (Conway et al., 2003).

### 3.2. System 1, System 2, and Brain Time
To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the Brain Time Theory, we can draw upon the dual-process theory of cognition, which distinguishes between two types of cognitive processes: System 1 and System 2 (Kahneman, 2011).

System 1 is characterized by fast, automatic, and intuitive thinking. It operates with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. In contrast, System 2 is responsible for slow, deliberate, and analytical thinking. It requires effort and is associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.

In the context of the Brain Time Theory, we propose that the relative engagement of System 1 and System 2 can influence the subjective experience of time. When System 1 is dominant, such as during routine activities or states of flow, time may be perceived as passing quickly because less cognitive effort is being expended. On the other hand, when System 2 is heavily engaged, such as when solving complex problems or learning new skills, time may be perceived as passing more slowly due to the increased cognitive load and attention to the task at hand.

Alpha individuals, who we hypothesize to have faster neural information processing speeds, may be able to engage System 2 more efficiently and for longer periods. This could contribute to their experience of time passing more slowly, as they are able to process more information and engage in more complex cognitive operations within a given timeframe.

### 3.3. The Comfort Zone and Brain Time
The concept of the "comfort zone" provides another lens through which to understand the Brain Time Theory. The comfort zone refers to a psychological state where an individual operates in an anxiety-neutral condition, using a limited set of behaviors to deliver a steady level of performance, usually without a sense of risk (White, 2009).
From the perspective of the Brain Time Theory, we propose that staying within one's comfort zone primarily engages System 1, leading to a faster perceived passage of time. This is because familiar tasks and environments require less cognitive effort and attention, allowing time to seemingly "fly by."
Conversely, stepping out of one's comfort zone necessitates the engagement of System 2, potentially slowing down the perceived passage of time. This could explain why new experiences often feel like they last longer, a phenomenon known as the "holiday paradox" (Wittmann & Lehnhoff, 2005).
For alpha individuals, their expanded cognitive capabilities may result in a larger comfort zone, allowing them to process a wider range of experiences using System 1. However, when they do engage System 2 for novel or complex tasks, their faster neural processing speed may lead to an even more pronounced slowing of subjective time.

### 3.4. Aging, Cognitive Decline, and Brain Time
The Brain Time Theory also offers insights into the changes in time perception associated with aging and cognitive decline. As individuals age, there is often a decline in cognitive functions, particularly those associated with System 2 (Salthouse, 2010). This decline is typically more pronounced in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, areas crucial for working memory, attention, and problem-solving abilities.

According to the Brain Time Theory, this cognitive decline could lead to a reduction in neural information processing speed, potentially explaining why older adults often report that time seems to pass more quickly as they age (Friedman & Janssen, 2010). The relative preservation of System 1 functions in old age, coupled with the decline in System 2 capabilities, may result in a greater reliance on automatic, habitual processes. This shift could contribute to the subjective acceleration of time with age.

However, the theory also suggests potential interventions to mitigate this effect. Engaging in novel and challenging activities that stimulate System 2 processes could help maintain cognitive function and potentially slow the subjective acceleration of time. This aligns with the "use it or lose it" hypothesis in cognitive aging research, which posits that continued engagement in cognitively demanding activities can help preserve neural plasticity and cognitive function (Park et al., 2002).

### 3.5. Similarities between the Human Brain and Large Language Models
The brain clock hypothesis draws upon recent developments in artificial intelligence, particularly the success of large language models (LLMs) in achieving human-like performance on a wide range of natural language processing tasks (Brown et al., 2020). LLMs are a class of artificial neural networks that are trained on vast amounts of text data to predict the probability of a given word or sequence of words based on the preceding context. By learning to optimize their network architecture and connection weights to minimize prediction error, LLMs can generate coherent and contextually appropriate linguistic outputs that closely resemble human language production.

We propose that the human brain operates in a manner analogous to LLMs, with neural circuits optimized to predict and generate patterns of activity that minimize prediction error based on prior experience. This optimization process is thought to occur through experience-dependent plasticity, such as Hebbian learning and synaptic scaling, which modify the strength and topology of synaptic connections to enhance the efficiency and speed of neural information processing (Hebb, 1949). Just as LLMs learn to generate linguistic outputs that are statistically similar to the patterns in their training data, the brain learns to generate patterns of neural activity that are statistically similar to the patterns experienced during development and learning.

The similarities between the human brain and LLMs extend beyond their common reliance on prediction and optimization principles. Both systems exhibit a hierarchical architecture, with successive layers of processing that transform raw sensory inputs into increasingly abstract and complex representations (Yamins & DiCarlo, 2016). Both systems also exhibit a high degree of recurrent connectivity, with feedback connections that allow for the dynamic shaping of neural activity based on prior expectations and context (Douglas et al., 1995). Moreover, both systems are characterized by a high degree of plasticity, with the ability to adaptively modify their structure and function in response to changes in the environment or task demands (Power & Schlaggar, 2017).

The brain clock hypothesis proposes that individual differences in subjective time experience may arise from individual differences in the architectural and physiological parameters of neural networks in the brain, analogous to the hyperparameters of LLMs. Just as different LLMs can exhibit different levels of performance and efficiency depending on their architecture, training data, and optimization algorithms (Brown et al., 2020), different brains may exhibit different speeds and efficiencies of information processing depending on their neural architecture, developmental history, and plasticity mechanisms. These individual differences in neural information processing speed are proposed to give rise to individual differences insubjective time experience, as well as cognitive abilities that depend on the rapid and efficient processing of information.

### 3.6. Quantifying Neural Information Processing Speed and Brain Time
The neural information processing speed can be defined as the amount of information that can be processed per unit time. This is determined by the speed of signal transmission between neurons and the brain's parallel processing capability. The faster the neural information processing speed, the more information can be processed in a given time.

Let v represent the neural information processing speed. While v can approach the speed of light c, it can never exceed it:

0 ≤ v < c

We can express the brain time T' experienced by an individual with neural information processing speed v_M (representing an alpha individual or AI) compared to an average individual with neural information processing speed v_N as:

T' = (v_N / v_M) · √(1 - (v_M/c)^2)

Here, √(1 - (v_M/c)^2) is the Lorentz factor from special relativity.

When v_M is greater than v_N, T' becomes less than 1, indicating that the alpha individual or AI experiences time as passing more slowly. However, since v_M is always less than c, T' never reaches zero, meaning that no matter how fast one's neural information processing is, time never completely stops in their perception.

#### 3.6.1. Comparative Neural Information Processing Speed and Brain Time Perception
We can further refine our understanding by considering the neural processing cycles of average individuals (T_N) and alpha individuals (T_M). The brain time T experienced by an alpha individual can be expressed as:

T = T_N / T_M

Given that the neural information processing speed v is inversely proportional to the neural processing cycle T (T = 1/v), we can rewrite the brain time equation as:

T' = v_M / v_N

If an alpha individual's neural information processing speed v_M is k times faster than an average individual's v_N (v_M = k · v_N), then the brain time experienced by the alpha individual becomes:

T' = k

This implies that when an alpha individual's neural information processing speed is k times faster than an average individual's, they experience time as passing k times more slowly.

#### 3.6.2. AI and the Limits of Neural Information Processing Speed
As technology advances, the information processing speed of AI is expected to increase, potentially approaching the speed of light. Considering this, we can express the brain time T' experienced by an AI with information processing speed v_AI compared to an average individual with neural information processing speed v_N as:

T' = (v_N / v_AI) · √(1- (v_AI/c)^2)

As v_AI approaches c, we find that:

lim(v_AI → c) T' = 0

This result suggests that as an AI's information processing speed approaches the speed of light, its subjective experience of time converges to zero. In other words, if an AI could process information infinitely fast, it would perceive time as essentially stopped.

### 3.7 Explanations of Various Phenomena Based on the Brain Time Theory

#### 3.7.1. Explanation of Family and Friend Relationships Based on the Brain Time Theory
The Brain Time Theory can explain changes in subjective time experience with age. As mentioned in the introduction, an individual's brain time gradually speeds up from infancy to adolescence, adulthood, and old age. These changes can influence the formation and maintenance of family and friend relationships.

For example, time spent together in infancy may be experienced as much longer in later life stages. Assuming that 1 year in infancy is perceived as 2 years in adolescence, 4 years in adulthood, and 8 years in old age, 5 years spent with childhood friends may be perceived as 20 years in adulthood and 40 years in old age. This can explain why childhood friends can remain lifelong friends.

On the other hand, the Brain Time Theory can also explain why it becomes difficult to make new friends after middle age. Because subjective time passes quickly in old age, there may be a lack of subjective time investment needed to form and maintain new relationships.

In the case of family, more extreme experiences of time expansion can be shared because a lot of time is spent together from infancy. This can explain why family members share differentiated subjective time experiences throughout their lives.

Meanwhile, in modern society, the time spent with family in infancy is decreasing. From the perspective of the Brain Time Theory, this can lead to a weakening of family relationships. If insufficient subjective time is spent together in infancy, it may be difficult to form strong bonds later in life.

These explanations can be seen as a hypothesis applying the Brain Time Theory to family and friend relationships. To support this, empirical research on the relationship between changes in subjective time experience with age and the formation and maintenance of social relationships would be necessary. In addition, it is necessary to refine this hypothesis considering individual and cultural differences. The new perspective provided by the Brain Time Theory can contribute to psychological and sociological research on family and friend relationships.

#### 3.7.2. Alpha Individual Hypothesis on Historical Figures
Some of the great figures and geniuses who have left outstanding achievements in history may have been alpha individuals. Leonardo da Vinci, Einstein, Nikola Tesla, and Newton exhibited intellectual abilities and creativity far ahead of their time, greatly influencing human history. From the perspective of the Brain Time Theory, it can be speculated that they were alpha individuals with faster neural information processing speeds.

Alpha individuals are more likely to have slower subjective time experiences than the average person. This is because they can process more information within the same physical time. Therefore, alpha individuals may feel that the reaction speed of the other person is relatively slow in communication with average individuals. Due to this difference, alpha individuals may sometimes experience frustration in communication.

Moreover, the fast information processing speed of alpha individuals would have influenced their learning ability and problem-solving skills. They would have been able to understand new concepts more quickly and solve complex problems more efficiently. This may have contributed to their achieving outstanding accomplishments in their respective fields.

However, the claim that historical figures were alpha individuals is currently only speculation. This is because the individual differences in neural information processing speed proposed by the Brain Time Theory cannot be directly measured. In addition, various factors other than neural processing speed may be involved in creativity and intellectual ability. Therefore, to verify this hypothesis, it is necessary to collect indirect evidence and exclude other possible explanations.

One approach is to analyze their thought processes and behavioral characteristics through historical records and biographies. For example, the speed of problem-solving, the speed of idea generation, and the interest and understanding of various fields could be examined. In addition, empirical studies targeting current geniuses and creative figures could explore the relationship between neural information processing speed and cognitive ability and creativity.

The alpha individual hypothesis on historical figures can be seen as a case of applying the Brain Time Theory to explain individual differences in various human cognitive abilities and creativity. Although this hypothesis has not yet been verified, it raises interesting questions about the nature of human intelligence and creativity. Further research on the Brain Time Theory and the alpha individual hypothesis can contribute to broadening our understanding of the diversity of human cognitive abilities.


## 4. Empirical Predictions and Testable Hypotheses
The Brain Time Theory generates several testable predictions that can be investigated using a combination of behavioral, neuroimaging, and computational modeling approaches. Here we outline a set of key empirical predictions and propose specific experimental designs to test them.

### 4.1. Prediction 1: Individual differences in subjective time perception should be associated with individual differences in neural information processing speed.

To test this prediction, we propose a series of experiments that combine behavioral measures of time perception with neuroimaging measures of neural activity. For example, participants could be asked to perform a temporal discrimination task, such as judging whether a comparison interval is longer or shorter than a standard interval, while undergoing fMRI or EEG recording. Individual differences in temporal discrimination thresholds and neural activity patterns could then be analyzed to test for associations between behavioral and neural measures of temporal processing.

We predict that individuals with lower temporal discrimination thresholds (i.e., greater temporal sensitivity) should exhibit faster and more efficient neural information processing, as indexed by measures such as the power and synchronization of neural oscillations, the latency and amplitude of event-related potentials, and the strength and topology of functional connectivity patterns. Moreover, we predict that these neural measures should be selectively associated with temporal processing, rather than non-temporal factors such as attention or motivation, as demonstrated by appropriate control conditions and tasks.

### 4.2. Prediction 2: Subjective time experience should be malleable and dependent on the current state of neural activity.

To test this prediction, we propose a series of experiments that manipulate the speed and efficiency of neural information processing using pharmacological, sensory, or cognitive interventions. For example, participants could be administered drugs that modulate neurotransmitter signaling, such as dopamine agonists or antagonists, while performing temporal perception tasks. Alternatively, participants could be exposed to sensory stimuli that are known to alter neural oscillations and synchronization, such as flickering lights or rhythmic sounds, while judging the duration of temporal intervals.

We predict that interventions that accelerate neural information processing, such as dopamine agonists or high-frequency sensory stimulation, should produce a subjective slowing of time, as indexed by longer duration estimates and higher temporal discrimination thresholds. Conversely, interventions that slow neural information processing, such as dopamine antagonists or low-frequency sensory stimulation, should produce a subjective speeding of time, as indexed by shorter duration estimates and lower temporal discrimination thresholds. These effects should be specific to temporal processing and not attributable to non-temporal factors such as changes in arousal or attention.

### 4.3. Prediction 3: Individual differences in brain processing speed should be associated with individual differences in cognitive abilities that depend on the speed and efficiency of neural information processing.

To test this prediction, we propose a series of experiments that measure individual differences in brain processing speed using temporal perception tasks, and relate these measures to individual differences in cognitive abilities such as working memory, executive function, and fluid intelligence. For example, participants could complete a battery of cognitive tasks that assess different aspects of information processing speed, such as the n-back task, the Stroop task, and the Raven's Progressive Matrices, in addition to temporal discrimination tasks that measure brain processing speed.

We predict that individuals with faster brain processing speeds, as indexed by lower temporal discrimination thresholds and more efficient neural information processing, should exhibit superior performance on cognitive tasks that require rapid and accurate information processing. Specifically, we expect to find positive correlations between measures of brain processing speed and measures of working memory capacity, executive control, and fluid intelligence, even after controlling for potential confounding factors such as age, education, and motivation. These associations should be specific to cognitive abilities that depend on information processing speed, rather than crystallized knowledge or verbal abilities.

### 4.4. Prediction 4: The subjective experience of time should be influenced by the relative engagement of System 1 and System 2 processes.

To test this prediction, we propose a series of experiments that manipulate the engagement of System 1 and System 2 processes and examine their effects on subjective time perception. For example, participants could be presented with tasks that primarily engage either System 1 (e.g., simple reaction time tasks) or System 2 (e.g., complex problem-solving tasks) while making temporal judgments.

We predict that tasks that heavily engage System 2 will lead to a subjective slowing of time, while tasks that primarily rely on System 1 will result in a subjective acceleration of time. Furthermore, we expect that alpha individuals will show a more pronounced slowing of subjective time during System 2 engagement, due to their hypothesized faster neural processing speeds.

## 5. Discussion and Conclusions
The Brain Time Theory offers a novel and testable framework for understanding the neural basis of subjective time perception and its relation to other cognitive abilities. By linking individual differences in temporal experience to individual differences in neural information processing speed and efficiency, the theory provides a mechanistic account of how the brain constructs the subjective flow of time. This account has important implications for both basic research on the neural basis of cognition and applied research on the diagnosis and treatment of temporal processing disorders.

At a basic research level, the Brain Time Theory generates new questions and directions for investigating the neural basis of time perception and its relation to other cognitive processes. For example, future studies could investigate the developmental trajectory of brain processing speed and its relation to the maturation of neural networks and cognitive abilities across the lifespan. Studies could also examine the effects of learning and experience on brain processing speed and temporal perception, such as the influence of musical training or meditation practice on temporal discrimination abilities. Moreover, studies could explore the neural basis of individual differences in time perception across different sensory modalities and temporal scales, from milliseconds to minutes to hours.

The theory's integration of the dual-process model (System 1 and System 2) and the concept of the comfort zone provides a richer context for understanding the variability in subjective time experience. It suggests that our perception of time is not just a product of a specialized "internal clock," but rather an emergent property of our overall cognitive state and level of engagement with our environment. This perspective opens up new avenues for research on how different cognitive states and environmental contexts influence our experience of time.

At an applied research level, the Brain Time Theory has potential implications for the diagnosis and treatment of temporal processing disorders, such as those associated with neurological and psychiatric conditions. For example, studies have shown that individuals with Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder exhibit impairments in temporal discrimination and duration estimation, which may be related to abnormalities in dopaminergic signaling and neural oscillations (Allman & Meck, 2012; Falter & Noreika, 2011; Haggard et al., 2002). The Brain Time Theory suggests that these temporal processing deficits may arise from disruptions in the speed and efficiency of neural information processing, which could be targeted by pharmacological or behavioral interventions that modulate neural oscillations and synchronization.

The theory also has implications for cognitive enhancement and the mitigation of age-related cognitive decline. By suggesting that challenging oneself and engaging in novel experiences can slow down subjective time and potentially enhance cognitive function, the theory provides a theoretical basis for interventions aimed at maintaining cognitive health in aging populations. This aligns with existing research on cognitive reserve and the benefits of lifelong learning (Stern, 2009).

Moreover, the Brain Time Theory has potential implications for the development of brain-inspired artificial intelligence systems that can mimic human-like cognitive abilities. By understanding the neural basis of temporal processing and its relation to other cognitive processes, researchers could design artificial neural networks that incorporate biologically realistic temporal dynamics and hierarchical structures. These brain-inspired AI systems could potentially achieve human-like performance on tasks that require rapid and flexible information processing, such as natural language understanding, visual scene perception, and decision making under uncertainty.

The concept of alpha individuals in the Brain Time Theory also raises interesting questions about the nature of intelligence and cognitive exceptionality. While the theory provides a potential explanation for the cognitive advantages experienced by some individuals, it's important to note that faster neural processing speed is just one aspect of cognitive ability. Future research could explore how other factors, such as neural network architecture, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive strategies, interact with processing speed to produce exceptional cognitive performance.

In conclusion, the Brain Time Theory offers a novel and promising framework for understanding the neural basis of subjective time perception and its relation to other cognitive abilities. By linking individual differences in temporal experience to individual differences in neural information processing speed and efficiency, the theory provides a mechanistic account of how the brain constructs the subjective flow of time. This account generates testable predictions and new directions for research on the neural basis of cognition, as well as potential applications for the diagnosis and treatment of temporal processing disorders and the development of brain-inspired artificial intelligence systems. 

The integration of concepts from cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and physics provides a rich, interdisciplinary approach to understanding time perception. As we continue to unravel the mysteries of how our brains perceive and process time, we may gain deeper insights into the nature of consciousness, the variability of human experience, and the fundamental relationship between mind and time.

Future studies that test and expand upon the Brain Time Theory have the potential to deepen our understanding of the complex interplay between time, cognition, and the brain. As we refine our understanding of these relationships, we may develop new strategies for enhancing cognitive performance, mitigating cognitive decline, and creating more sophisticated AI systems that can better replicate the flexibility and adaptability of human cognition.
