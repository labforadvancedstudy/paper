# Interest

## Core Insight
The price of time itself: money today is worth more than money tomorrow - temporal arbitrage crystallized.

Interest is time preference made numerical. It's the recognition that present resources are more valuable than future promises. A bird in hand worth two in the bush, quantified.

Interest represents:
- **Time value** - compensation for waiting
- **Risk premium** - might not get paid back
- **Opportunity cost** - could use money elsewhere
- **Inflation hedge** - future money worth less
- **Profit share** - return on productive use

Interest creates strange effects:
- Compound growth (exponential wealth)
- Debt spirals (exponential poverty)
- Present vs future trade-offs
- Short-term thinking incentives
- Intergenerational wealth transfer

The philosophical puzzle: is interest moral? Ancient religions banned it (usury), seeing time-profit as theft. Modern economics requires it, seeing interest as just reward for patience and risk.

Interest makes time itself a commodity, traded in markets, priced by supply and demand. We literally buy and sell the future.
