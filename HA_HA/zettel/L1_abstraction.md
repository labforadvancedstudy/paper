# Abstraction

## Core Insight
The art of forgetting the right details - keeping what matters, discarding what doesn't, and knowing the difference.

Abstraction is compression with purpose. When you say "tree" instead of describing every leaf, branch, and bark pattern, you're abstracting. You lose detail but gain power - now you can talk about forests, not just that one oak.

But abstraction isn't just simplification. It's selective simplification. A map that shows every blade of grass is useless. A map that shows only oceans is also useless. The genius is knowing what to keep for your purpose.

Every abstraction has a cost: detail loss. But it has a benefit: cognitive manageability. We can't hold infinite detail in our minds. Abstraction lets us think about things too complex to grasp directly.

The paradox: to abstract well, you must first understand the details you're discarding. Only when you know what doesn't matter can you safely ignore it. Masters abstract better because they've internalized the details.
