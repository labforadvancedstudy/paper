# Life as Computation

## Core Insight
Life might not be about carbon and water but about information processing - biology is software running on chemical hardware.

Every cell is a computer. DNA is the hard drive, RNA is RAM, proteins are the processors, and metabolism is the power supply. But unlike our computers, this one rewrites its own code, builds new hardware, and decides its own goals.

The computational view is compelling: evolution is a search algorithm exploring the space of possible organisms. Development is a program unfolding. The brain is obviously computing. Even the immune system computes, learning patterns and calculating responses. Life computes at every level.

But it's stranger than our computers. This computation is embodied - the hardware and software are inseparable. The program modifies itself while running. The computer builds copies of itself. It's not computing abstract symbols but its own physical existence.

The deep question: is life computing, or is computation living? When we build AI, are we creating new life or discovering that life was always computational? The distinction between animate and inanimate might not be about carbon versus silicon, but about information processing versus inert matter.
