# Status

## Core Insight
The invisible hierarchy that organizes social interaction - everyone knows their place without anyone saying it aloud.

Watch any group of strangers meet. Within minutes, a pecking order emerges. Who speaks first, who gets interrupted, who others look to for decisions. Status isn't assigned; it crystallizes from countless micro-negotiations.

Status markers vary wildly: muscles in a gym, vocabulary in academia, followers on Instagram. But the game is universal - humans constantly signal and assess relative position. Even "I don't care about status" is a status move (too cool to play).

The cruel genius of status: it's relative. Everyone can't be high status; someone must be low for high to exist. This creates endless competition and surprising cooperation (allies can raise each other's status).
