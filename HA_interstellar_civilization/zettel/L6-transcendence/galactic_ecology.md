# Galactic Ecology

## Core Insight
A galaxy with multiple civilizations becomes an ecology where species compete for resources, stellar systems fill niches, and intelligence evolves new forms through interaction and isolation across cosmic time.

Just as Earth's ecology has producers, consumers, and decomposers, a galactic ecology might develop:

**Stellar Gardeners**
- Civilizations that modify stars
- Extend stellar lifespans
- Create optimal conditions
- "Farm" stellar energy
- Maintain their territory

**System Miners**
- Strip-mine dead systems
- Process asteroids/planets
- Leave husks behind
- Highly mobile
- Locust-like behavior?

**Information Traders**
- Deal only in data/culture
- Minimal physical presence
- Network connectors
- Preserve/spread knowledge
- Galactic memory

**Void Dwellers**
- Live between stars
- Harvest dark matter?
- Avoid system conflicts
- Different physics mastery
- Invisible to others

**Transcendent Observers**
- Post-physical entities
- Don't compete for matter
- Possibly protective role
- Living in higher dimensions?
- Galaxy's "wise elders"

The ecology creates:
- Resource competition but cosmic scale
- Predator-prey dynamics (civilizations eating others?)
- Symbiosis (mutual benefit across species)
- Extinction events (what kills star-civilizations?)
- Evolutionary pressure (driving transcendence?)

This reframes the galaxy not as empty real estate but as a living system where intelligences fill roles, creating stability or chaos across millions of years.
