# Quasar Discovery

## Core Insight
Quasars - "quasi-stellar objects" - turned out to be the universe's most luminous objects: supermassive black holes consuming galaxies, visible across billions of light-years, illuminating the early universe.

In 1963, Maarten Schmidt studied 3C 273, a star-like object with bizarre spectral lines. The breakthrough: recognizing hydrogen lines massively redshifted. This "star" was 2.4 billion light-years away yet visible - implying luminosity exceeding entire galaxies from a region smaller than our Solar System.

Quasars revolutionized astronomy. Their energy comes from matter spiraling into supermassive black holes, converting gravitational potential to radiation with 10% efficiency (fusion manages 0.7%). They're active galactic nuclei - young galaxies with feeding black holes. As cosmic beacons, quasars probe the distant universe. Their light passes through intervening gas clouds, creating absorption lines that map cosmic structure. They show the universe's youth was violent, with galaxy collisions triggering black hole feeding frenzies. Today's quiet galaxies, including ours, harbor dormant quasars - supermassive black holes that once blazed across the cosmos.
