# Trust

## Core Insight
The invisible glue of society - the willingness to be vulnerable to others that makes all cooperation possible.

Trust is society's dark matter - invisible but holding everything together. Every transaction assumes the other won't cheat. Every conversation assumes shared meaning. Every institution runs on trust that others will play their roles.

The trust paradox: it's rational to distrust (others might defect) but without trust, nothing works. So we leap - trusting doctors we've never met, pilots we'll never see, systems we don't understand. Modern life is a trust fall with 8 billion strangers.

Trust scales through institutions (I trust you because we both trust the law) and reputation (I trust you because others trust you). But the foundation remains mysterious: why does anyone trust anyone first?
