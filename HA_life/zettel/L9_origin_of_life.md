# Origin of Life

## Core Insight
The hardest question in science: how did chemistry become biology? How did matter first decide to matter?

We know when: roughly 4 billion years ago. We know where: probably deep-sea vents or warm ponds. We even know some of the ingredients: water, carbon, energy gradients. But the crucial step - the moment when chemistry caught fire and became life - remains mysterious.

The paradox is vicious: modern life needs DNA to store information, RNA to process it, and proteins to do the work. But DNA needs proteins to replicate, proteins need RNA to be made, and RNA needs both to function. It's like asking whether the chicken, the egg, or the nest came first - when you need all three.

Leading ideas compete: RNA world (RNA doing everything), metabolism first (chemical cycles before genetics), or lipid world (containers before contents). Each solves some problems but creates others. Maybe they're all right - life sparked multiple times in multiple ways.

The unsettling possibility: it might have been absurdly improbable. Perhaps life is a one-in-a-universe accident, and we're here only because in the universes where it didn't happen, no one's around to wonder. Or perhaps life is inevitable, and the universe is rigged to create observers. We don't know which is more disturbing.
