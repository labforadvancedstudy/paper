# Metabolism

## Core Insight
Life is a slow fire that rebuilds itself while burning - the impossible trick of using energy to fight energy's tendency to disperse.

Imagine trying to repair a car while driving it at full speed. Now imagine the car is made of the fuel it's burning. That's metabolism: simultaneously destroying and building yourself, forever.

Every second, you break down millions of molecules to release energy (catabolism), and use that energy to build millions more (anabolism). You're not a thing - you're a pattern of chemical reactions, a standing wave in the flow of matter and energy.

The miracle: it's self-regulating. Too much energy? Store it. Too little? Break down stores. Temperature rising? Slow down. pH shifting? Buffer it. Thousands of reactions, all interdependent, all balanced. One enzyme fails, and the whole system adapts or dies.

But here's the cost: you can never stop. Metabolism is like juggling while running - pause for too long and everything crashes. This is why we eat, why we breathe, why we must keep the fire burning. Life is not a state; it's a process that ends the moment it stops processing.
