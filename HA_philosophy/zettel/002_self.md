# Self

## Core Insight
The persistent illusion of continuity - a pattern that insists it exists.

## The Pattern That Thinks It's Real

Every morning you wake up convinced you're the same person. But are you? Your cells have changed, your thoughts are different, even your memories have been edited in sleep. 

The self is like a river claiming to be the same water. At L1, self is body. At L3, self is mind. At L5, self is narrative. At L7, self dissolves into processes. At L9, even the processes are just perturbations in fields of possibility.

The deepest joke: the self that fears death doesn't exist in the first place.
