# 003 Synaptic Transmission - Cell Talk

Where electricity becomes chemistry. The 20nm gap that makes
thought possible.

## Process
1. Action potential arrives at terminal
2. Ca2+ influx triggers vesicle fusion
3. Neurotransmitter release (quantal)
4. Receptor binding on postsynaptic cell
5. Signal integration → new potential?

## Types
- Chemical: 100μs delay, modulatable
- Electrical: <1μs, direct coupling
- Volume: Diffuse signaling

## Computation
Each neuron: ~10,000 inputs → 1 output
Weighted sum + nonlinearity = neural computation

The synapse is the transistor. But unlike silicon, it learns.
