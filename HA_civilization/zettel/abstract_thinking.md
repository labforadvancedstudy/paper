# Abstract Thinking

## Core Insight
Abstract thinking is consciousness eating its own tail - using symbols to think about symbols thinking about symbols.

A chimp sees three apples. Humans see "three" - the pattern that unites three apples, three days, three ideas. We extracted the "threeness" from reality and made it a thing itself.

This recursion has no limit. We have words for words ("noun"), ideas about ideas ("metacognition"), rules about rules ("constitutions"). Each abstraction layer enables new thoughts impossible at lower layers.

But abstraction has a cost: distance from reality. The more abstract, the easier to get lost in symbol-space. Entire civilizations have collapsed arguing about abstractions while ignoring concrete reality.
