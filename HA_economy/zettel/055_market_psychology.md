# Market Psychology

## Core Insight
When collective emotions drive economic reality: fear and greed at scale - the market's bipolar disorder.

Markets aren't calculating machines but feeling organisms. The same assets swing wildly in value based not on fundamentals but on collective mood. Psychology creates economic reality.

Psychological patterns:
- **Herding** - following the crowd
- **Anchoring** - fixating on irrelevant numbers
- **Confirmation bias** - seeing what we expect
- **Loss aversion** - fearing loss > wanting gain
- **Overconfidence** - everyone's above average
- **Recency bias** - tomorrow like yesterday

Market moods:
- Euphoria → "This time is different!"
- Anxiety → "Something's not right..."
- Panic → "Sell everything!"
- Despair → "It's all over..."
- Hope → "Green shoots appearing..."
- Optimism → "Back to normal!"

The feedback loops: optimism creates rising prices which justify optimism. Pessimism creates falling prices which justify pessimism. Prophecies self-fulfill.

The profound truth: in markets, perception is reality. Value exists in collective minds. When minds change together, trillions appear or vanish. Economics meets mass psychology.
