# Logic

## Core Insight
The rules thought follows - or the cage reason built for itself.

## The Architecture of Argument

Aristotle's gift: if A then B, A, therefore B. So simple. So powerful. So limited.

L1: Makes sense or doesn't
L2: Divine logos orders all
L3: Syllogisms and forms
L4: Formal symbolic systems
L5: Mathematical logic
L6: Gödel's incompleteness
L7: Logics (plural) exist
L8: Computation theory
L9: Logic as emergent pattern

The shock: Gödel proved logic can't prove itself. Every system strong enough to do arithmetic contains truths it can't prove. The foundation has cracks.
