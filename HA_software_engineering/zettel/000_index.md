1. Software is thought made executable
2. Right abstraction level is crucial
3. Technical debt is investment tool
4. Testing builds confidence, not perfection
5. Architecture emerges from constraints
6. Code is primarily for humans
7. Distributed systems trade simplicity for scale
8. Software evolves like organisms
9. People problems harder than technical
