# Celestial Mechanics

## Core Insight
Newton's gravity plus calculus equals prophecy - we can predict celestial positions centuries ahead, turning astronomy from observation into precise mathematical machinery.

Before Newton, astronomy meant recording and pattern-finding. After Newton, it became calculation. His law of universal gravitation, combined with calculus, let astronomers compute rather than just observe. Given positions and velocities, future positions follow inevitably. Planets aren't wandering; they're solving differential equations.

The triumph came with predictions. Halley used Newton's methods to predict his comet's return - it arrived on schedule in 1758, after his death. Perturbations in Uranus's orbit led to Neptune's discovery by calculation before observation. Celestial mechanics reached such precision that tiny discrepancies (like Mercury's perihelion advance) revealed new physics (general relativity). We now track thousands of asteroids, predict eclipses millennia ahead, and navigate spacecraft across billions of kilometers. The clockwork universe exists - we just needed the right mathematics to read its gears.
