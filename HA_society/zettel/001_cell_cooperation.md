# Cell Cooperation

3.5 billion years ago, cells discovered: together > alone.

First social contract:
- Share resources
- Divide labor  
- Synchronize activities
- Die for the group

Stromatolites = first cities.
Biofilms = first societies.
No brain, no meeting, yet perfect coordination.

Cells voting through chemical gradients.
Democracy before neurons existed.
