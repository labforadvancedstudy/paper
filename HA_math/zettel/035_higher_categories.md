# Higher Categories and n-Dimensional Algebra

## Core Insight
Higher categories extend categories by adding morphisms between morphisms, iterating to infinity - revealing that mathematical relationships have infinite depth.

## Content
Categories have objects and morphisms. But morphisms can be related too - by 2-morphisms. And 2-morphisms can be related by 3-morphisms. This tower has no top.

The hierarchy:
- 0-category: set (just objects)
- 1-category: ordinary category
- 2-category: morphisms between morphisms
- n-category: morphisms up to dimension n
- ∞-category: morphisms all the way up

Examples illuminate:
- 2-category: categories, functors, natural transformations
- ∞-category: spaces, continuous maps, homotopies, higher homotopies

Why go higher?
- Natural transformations aren't enough
- Coherence conditions multiply
- Higher symmetries exist
- Physics demands it

Different models:
- Strict: all laws hold exactly
- Weak: laws hold up to isomorphism
- Quasi-categories: simplicial sets approach
- ∞-operads: operations viewpoint

Key insight: weakness is strength
- Strict n-categories too rigid
- Weak versions capture phenomena
- Everything equivalent that should be
- Coherence emerges

Applications:
- Topological quantum field theory
- Derived algebraic geometry
- Higher gauge theory
- Computational type theory

Higher categories revealed that the arrow → was just the beginning.
