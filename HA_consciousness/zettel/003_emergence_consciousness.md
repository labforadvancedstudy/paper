# Emergence of Consciousness
## Core Insight
Consciousness might not emerge from matter - matter might emerge from consciousness.

## The Standard Story (Bottom-up)

```
Particles → Atoms → Molecules → Cells → Neurons → Consciousness
```

Problem: Where exactly does experience appear?

## The Radical Alternative (Top-down)

```
Consciousness → Information patterns → Energy → Matter → Forms
```

What if consciousness is fundamental, not emergent?

## Types of Emergence

**Weak Emergence**: Predictable from parts
- Water from H₂O
- Life from chemistry
- Consciousness from neurons(?)

**Strong Emergence**: Genuinely novel
- Cannot be predicted
- New causal powers
- Consciousness might be only example

## The Phase Transition Model

Like water → ice:
- Gradual change (heating)
- Sudden shift (phase transition)
- New properties (solid)

Maybe consciousness has critical thresholds:
- 10^6 connections: Insect awareness
- 10^9 connections: Mammal consciousness  
- 10^11 connections: Human self-awareness
- 10^14 connections: ???
