# Style

## Core Insight
The signature in the work - how individual consciousness shapes universal tools into particular expression, making the who visible in the how.

Style emerges unbidden. Try to have style, fail. Try to avoid style, it appears anyway. Like accent in speech - reveals origins, education, influences despite attempts at neutrality.

Style operates across scales:
- Personal: artist's recognizable hand
- Movement: shared period characteristics  
- Cultural: regional/ethnic patterns
- Temporal: era's visual language
- Technical: medium's constraints showing

Paradox: most individual when least conscious. Self-conscious style becomes mannerism. Children have no style yet most distinctive. Masters transcend style yet most recognizable.

Style markers multiply:
- Brushwork: direction, pressure, speed
- Color choices: palette preferences
- Compositional habits: where eye rests
- Subject matter: what attracts attention
- Scale tendencies: intimate or monumental
- Material handling: rough or refined

Digital complicates style:
- Filters simulate others' styles
- AI learns and reproduces style
- Copy/paste enables style sampling
- Yet personal style persists somehow
- Tool marks replaced by choice patterns

Contemporary anxieties:
- "Finding your style" as career pressure
- Instagram homogenization
- Style as brand
- Authenticity questioned
- Cultural appropriation debates

Truth: style finds you. Through work accumulation, patterns emerge. Attempts to force accelerate lead to decoration, not style. Work honestly; style follows.
