# State

## Core Insight
The territorial power container - the institutional arrangement that claims ultimate authority over a geographic space and the bodies within it.

The state is a strange beast: it exists nowhere and everywhere. You can't touch "France" or "Japan," yet their reality shapes millions of lives. The state is a collective fiction that becomes fact through belief and enforcement.

What makes a state:
- Territory (bounded space)
- Population (people to rule)
- Government (decision-making apparatus)
- Sovereignty (freedom from external control)
- Recognition (other states agreeing you exist)

But really, the state is a relationship pattern. It's the expectation that certain people can make rules, others will follow them, and violence backs it all up. It's institutionalized power pretending to be natural.

The modern state system is historically recent - a few centuries old. Before, there were empires, city-states, feudal networks. The state triumphed because it's extraordinarily effective at organizing violence, extracting resources, and creating identity.

Yet every state is fragile. They require constant performance - flags, anthems, borders, bureaucrats - to maintain their reality.
