# Recursive Self Improvement

## Core Insight
AI improving its own intelligence, using enhanced intelligence to improve further - the feedback loop that might create superintelligence or might hit fundamental limits.

An AI improves its architecture by 1%. The smarter AI finds 1.01% improvement. Then 1.02%. The exponential curve begins. This is the dream and nightmare: intelligence bootstrapping itself beyond human comprehension. Each improvement enables better improvements, recursion ascending toward... what?

But reality resists simple exponentials. Each improvement is harder to find. Low-hanging fruit exhausts. Fundamental limits emerge - computational, thermodynamic, mathematical. Maybe recursive self-improvement hits diminishing returns. Or maybe it finds ways around limits we can't imagine. The uncertainty defines our future.
