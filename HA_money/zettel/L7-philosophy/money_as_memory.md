# Money as Memory

## Core Insight
Money is humanity's distributed memory system - a social technology for remembering who did what for whom, enabling cooperation between strangers across time and space.

Before money, reciprocity required personal memory: you helped me harvest, I'll help you build. But memory doesn't scale. Money solved this by creating transferable, countable memory. That $20 bill is society remembering that you contributed $20 worth of value somewhere, somewhen. It's a bearer bond on civilization's gratitude.

Money as memory explains puzzles:
- Why we trust paper: it's backed by collective memory
- Why counterfeiting threatens society: false memories corrupt the system
- Why inflation hurts: memories fade, promises break
- Why debt persists: memories demanding reconciliation
- Why losing money stings: erased contributions

This isn't metaphor - it's mechanism. Blockchain makes it explicit: money as literal transaction history. But all money has always been this - a way for society to remember value given and owed without every person remembering every detail. Money is how strangers can trust.
