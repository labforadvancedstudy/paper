# Trading

## Core Insight
The moment two children swap toys, markets are born - different desires create mutual benefit.

"I'll trade you my red car for your blue truck." In this playground moment lies all of economics. Trading is the discovery that we can both win by exchanging what we have for what we want more.

Trading reveals:
- **Subjective value** - my trash, your treasure
- **Mutual benefit** - we're both happier after
- **Negotiation** - finding the balance point
- **Trust** - the trade must complete
- **Preference** - we want different things

A five-year-old trading Pokémon cards understands:
- Relative value (Charizard > Pidgey)
- Market dynamics (rare = valuable)
- Negotiation ("I'll throw in a Squirtle")
- Regret ("I want my card back!")
- Speculation ("This will be worth more later")

Every market, from village bazaar to Wall Street, is just elaborate variations on "wanna trade?" The magic: both parties walk away richer in their own eyes. Value created from nothing but difference in desire.

Trading is humanity's superpower - turning diversity of wants into collective wealth.
