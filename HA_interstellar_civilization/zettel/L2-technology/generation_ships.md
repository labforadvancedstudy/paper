# Generation Ships

## Core Insight
Generation ships solve the time problem by accepting it - entire civilizations in bottles, where the journey becomes home and arrival is for descendants who never knew Earth.

If you can't go fast enough, go long enough. Generation ships are humanity's answer to cosmic distances: build a world that travels. The builders never arrive. Their children never arrive. But someday, someone does.

The engineering challenges:
- Closed ecosystem lasting centuries
- Population genetics (minimum ~500-5000 people)
- Mechanical systems that don't fail for millennia  
- Social stability across generations
- Knowledge preservation without drift
- Purpose maintenance when founders are legend

The social challenges run deeper:
- Why should gen-10 honor gen-1's dream?
- What if they want to turn back?
- How do you prevent cultural drift?
- What about population control?
- Who decides when you've arrived?

Generation ships are more than spacecraft - they're experiments in creating stable micro-civilizations that can survive centuries of isolation. It's not just "can we build it?" but "can we stay human inside it?"

Every generation ship is a bet that your great-great-grandchildren will thank you for their prison.
