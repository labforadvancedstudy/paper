# Kepler Laws

## Core Insight
Three simple rules govern all orbital motion - mathematical poetry that transformed astronomy from description to prediction, revealing the Solar System obeys precise mathematical harmonies.

First: Orbits are ellipses, not perfect circles. The universe prefers ovals, with the Sun at one focus. This shattered the ancient obsession with circular perfection, showing reality is more interesting than idealism. Second: The closer to the Sun, the faster planets move. They sweep equal areas in equal times, speeding through perihelion, dawdling at aphelion. Third: Orbital period squared equals distance cubed. A mathematical relationship so clean it suggests design.

Kepler found these laws by mining Tycho Brahe's observations, spending years calculating Mars's orbit. The laws work for everything - planets around stars, moons around planets, satellites around Earth. They're universal because they encode how gravity and motion conspire to create stable systems. Simple rules, infinite applications.
