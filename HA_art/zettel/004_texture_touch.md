# Texture Touch

## Core Insight
We see with our skin memory - rough, smooth, soft, sharp all trigger phantom sensations just by looking, making texture art's most intimate element.

Your fingers know textures your eyes have never touched. See tree bark, feel roughness. See silk, feel smoothness. See broken glass, feel danger. This synesthesia - seeing touch - is hardwired. We can't not feel what we see.

Texture speaks through:
- Rough: authenticity, age, struggle, earth
- Smooth: refinement, completion, ease, water
- Soft: comfort, vulnerability, invitation, flesh
- Hard: permanence, resistance, boundary, bone
- Sticky: discomfort, trap, humidity, web
- Dry: thirst, desert, paper, dust

Artists manipulate this touch-without-touching. Van Gogh's thick impasto makes you feel the paint's weight. Vermeer's surfaces seem touchable - pearl's coolness, velvet's warmth. Sculpture begs for hands despite "Do Not Touch" signs.

Digital art struggles here. Screens are uniformly smooth, cold. Yet we project texture - seeing pixelated as "rough," gradients as "smooth." The brain insists on feeling what it sees.

Children understand texture before form. They'll ignore a drawing's subject to trace raised lines with fingertips. They're right - texture is information, emotion, memory. It's how we first knew the world, crawling, grasping, mouthing everything.
