# Taxation

## Core Insight
Taxation is compulsory sharing - the technology that transforms individual resources into collective capacity.

Every society faces a problem: some things benefit everyone but no one wants to pay for them. Roads, courts, armies, research - these create value for all but profit for none. Taxation solves this by making everyone contribute to common goods.

But taxation is also coercion with paperwork. Men with guns (eventually) ensure you pay. This raw power is wrapped in layers of legitimacy - democratic consent, legal process, social contract. Still, at bottom, it's the many taking from each by force of law.

The fascinating part is how taxation shapes behavior. Tax cigarettes, people smoke less. Subsidize solar panels, more appear on roofs. Give deductions for charity, donations increase. Tax codes become de facto policy tools, encoding society's values in rates and exemptions.

Progressive taxation adds another layer - taking more from those who have more. This isn't just about revenue; it's about preventing wealth from concentrating until democracy becomes plutocracy. But where to draw the lines? Too little progressivity and inequality explodes. Too much and the rich flee or stop producing.

Taxation reveals the eternal tension between individual and collective, freedom and cooperation, efficiency and equity.
