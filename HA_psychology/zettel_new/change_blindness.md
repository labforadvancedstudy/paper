# Change Blindness

The surprising inability to detect large changes in a visual scene, especially when the change occurs during a brief interruption or distraction.

## Mechanism
Our visual system doesn't continuously monitor everything. Instead, it samples the environment and assumes stability between samples. During interruptions, we fail to compare before/after states.

## Classic Example
In experiments where people give directions to a stranger, if workers carrying a door pass between them (blocking view momentarily), most people don't notice when the stranger is replaced by someone else entirely.

## Implications
- We see far less than we think
- Attention is highly selective
- Memory for scenes is sparse
- Magicians exploit this limitation
