# Trade Economics

## Core Insight
Interstellar trade can't work like Earth trade - when shipping takes decades and costs fortunes, only information, culture, and absolutely unique items justify the journey.

Forget shipping grain between stars. The economics are absurd. If it takes 50 years and gigajoules of energy to move cargo, that cargo better be worth more than its weight in antimatter.

What actually gets traded:
- **Information**: Scientific data, technologies, art
- **Genetics**: New crops, organisms, DNA sequences
- **Culture**: Stories, philosophies, religions
- **Unique items**: Alien artifacts, impossible materials
- **People**: Specialists, genetic diversity, artists

The economics are strange:
- No supply/demand in normal sense
- Decades between order and delivery
- Payment across generations
- Value drift during transit
- Insurance for century-long trips

New economic models:
- **Information economies**: Data as primary value
- **Genetic libraries**: Life as currency
- **Cultural exchanges**: Ideas worth traveling for
- **Expertise export**: Sending teachers, not goods
- **Time-shifted value**: Betting on future needs

The real insight: Interstellar trade isn't about things, it's about uniqueness. You don't trade what you have, you trade what only you have. Every star system becomes Earth's only provider of... itself.
