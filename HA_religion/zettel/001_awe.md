# Awe

## Core Insight
The overwhelming smallness before immensity - when the ego dissolves in the face of the infinite.

Before any theology, before any doctrine, there is the sharp intake of breath when confronting something vast beyond comprehension. A child seeing the ocean for the first time. Standing beneath stars. The moment when scale breaks the mind open.

Awe is the primal religious experience:
- Self temporarily disappears
- Time seems to stop or stretch
- Words become inadequate
- Body often responds (goosebumps, tears, trembling)
- Desperate need to share yet impossibility of communication

The mountain doesn't care about human categories. The storm doesn't speak our language. Yet in that indifference lies something that feels like presence. Awe is recognition of the More - more than self, more than human, more than comprehensible.

Every religion begins here: the moment when someone looked up, or out, or in, and gasped at what they found. Before priests, before books, before buildings - just a human being struck dumb by existence.

Awe is the crack where the sacred enters.
