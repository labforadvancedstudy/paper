# Attachment: Secure Base

**Core Concept**: Attachment provides a secure base from which to explore the world.

## One-Line Definition
A trusted caregiver serves as both safe haven (comfort) and secure base (exploration).

## Simple Mental Model
Like a phone charger - you venture out knowing you can return to recharge when needed.

## Key Mechanism
1. Proximity seeking when threatened
2. Safe haven for comfort
3. Secure base for exploration
4. Separation distress when apart

## Practical Example
A toddler at a playground constantly checks back with their parent. Each glance is like touching base - "Still there? Good!" - before venturing further on the jungle gym.

## Common Misconception
Secure attachment means never being upset. Actually, securely attached children cry MORE when separated - they trust their distress will bring comfort.
