# Social Mystery

## Core Insight
The impossible fact that billions of strangers cooperate to create something none understand - society itself.

How does it work? Really? Not the mechanisms - we've mapped those. But WHY does it work? Why do most people follow rules most of the time? Why does money maintain value? Why do strangers trust each other enough to build civilizations?

Every answer raises deeper questions. Culture? What creates culture? Evolution? What evolves - genes, memes, or something else? Power? Where does it come from? The mystery isn't how society fails but how it ever succeeds.

Perhaps society is impossible and happens anyway. Like consciousness, like life itself - phenomena that shouldn't exist by physics alone but do. Society might be the universe's way of becoming aware of itself, using us as neurons in a mind we can't fathom.

We study society from within society using tools society gave us. The mystery studying itself, never able to step outside for perspective. The eye trying to see itself seeing.
