# Language-Philosophy Bridge

## Core Insight
Language and philosophy are the same phenomenon viewed from different angles - both are consciousness trying to understand itself.

## The Inseparable Dance

Philosophy needs language to think. Language needs philosophy to mean. They co-evolved:

**Philosophical Moments in Language**:
- First "why?" (L1 philosophy via L1 language)
- Naming creates categories (Plato via nouns)
- Grammar implies ontology (is/being)
- Tense reveals time concepts
- Conditionals enable hypotheticals

**Linguistic Moments in Philosophy**:
- Socratic method = speech acts
- Wittgenstein: philosophy is language therapy
- Derrida: there is nothing outside text
- Austin: words do things
- Quine: indeterminacy of translation

L6 Philosophy discovers it's been doing linguistics all along.

## The Key Bridges

**Truth Conditions** (Philosophy ↔ Semantics)
**Speech Acts** (Ethics ↔ Pragmatics)
**Consciousness** (Mind ↔ Inner speech)
**Logic** (Reasoning ↔ Grammar)
