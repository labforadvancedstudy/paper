# Development Economics

## Core Insight
Development economics studies the greatest magic trick: how nations transform from poverty to prosperity, and why some get stuck halfway.

South Korea in 1960 was poorer than Sudan. Today it exports smartphones and K-pop. Meanwhile, Argentina was rich in 1900 but got stuck in the "middle income trap." What explains these divergent paths?

Development isn't just about GDP growth. It's about transformation - from farms to factories to services, from tradition to innovation, from closed to open. It requires not just capital but institutions, not just resources but capabilities, not just growth but structural change.

The puzzle has many pieces: education (human capital), infrastructure (physical capital), institutions (social capital), and technology (knowledge capital). But the order matters. Build factories without education and you get sweatshops. Education without opportunity creates brain drain. Democracy without institutions breeds chaos.

There's also the curse of resources. Countries with oil often develop slower than those without. Easy wealth corrupts institutions, currencies appreciate making other exports uncompetitive, and why innovate when you can just drill? Norway escaped this curse; Venezuela didn't.

Development economics confronts the hardest question: can prosperity be engineered, or does it emerge from cultural and historical accidents? The answer shapes the fate of billions.
