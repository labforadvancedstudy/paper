# Territory Marking

Property rights before law.

Methods:
- Scent marks (dogs, cats)
- Visual marks (bears on trees)
- Sound boundaries (bird song)
- Physical structures (beaver dams)

Dear enemy effect: Known neighbors tolerated.
Strangers attacked.

Territories reduce conflict.
Clear boundaries = fewer fights.
