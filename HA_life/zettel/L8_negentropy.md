# Negentropy

## Core Insight
Life's accounting trick - borrowing order from the environment and paying back with interest in disorder.

Schrödinger coined "negative entropy" to describe what life feeds on. Not energy per se, but organized energy - the difference between a battery and a dead battery's heat. Life doesn't create order from nothing; it imports it.

Sunlight is pure negentropy - concentrated energy streaming from a 6000K surface. Plants capture it, converting photons into chemical bonds. Every organism either eats plants, eats plant-eaters, or eats sunshine directly. We're all dining on the sun's order.

But here's the trick: we increase total entropy while decreasing it locally. A cow concentrates grass into beef - local order increase. But it radiates heat, produces methane, creates waste - total disorder increase. Life is an entropy pump, creating islands of order in an ocean of increasing chaos.

The deepest insight: information is negative entropy. DNA, memories, thoughts - all are patches of order in the universe's tendency toward disorder. Consciousness might be the universe's most extreme negentropy accumulator, creating meaning from meaninglessness.
