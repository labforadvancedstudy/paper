# Labor

## Core Insight
Human energy transformed into economic force - where biology meets economy in sweat and time.

Labor is life force spent for gain. It's the irreversible exchange of human hours for economic output. Every product contains crystallized labor - someone's finite existence transformed into thing or service.

Labor dimensions:
- **Physical** - muscles moving matter
- **Mental** - brains solving problems  
- **Emotional** - caring, serving, performing
- **Creative** - imagining into existence
- **Temporal** - time that won't return

Labor's peculiarities:
- Can't be stored (work now or never)
- Quality varies wildly (skill matters)
- Tied to human limits (fatigue is real)
- Often location-bound (must be present)
- Deeply personal (my effort, my time)

The labor paradox: we must sell our life to live. Every wage is a price on human time. Every product price includes countless human hours.

Labor is where economics gets personal - it's not abstract resources but actual human lives being exchanged. The ethical heart of economics: how much is a human hour worth?
