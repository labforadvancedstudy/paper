# Organizational Design

## Core Insight
Organizational design is social architecture - deliberately structuring human relationships to channel collective energy toward shared purpose.

Structure shapes behavior. Functional silos create expertise but hinder collaboration. Cross-functional teams boost innovation but blur accountability. Matrix organizations balance both but create complexity. There's no perfect structure, only trade-offs.

Design goes beyond org charts. It includes: decision rights (who can say yes), information flows (who knows what), incentives (what gets rewarded), and processes (how work flows). These invisible architectures matter more than visible hierarchies.

The best designs are coherent - all elements align toward strategy. Sales-driven companies organize around customers. Engineering companies organize around products. The structure should make the important things easy and the wrong things hard.
