# Qualia

## Core Insight
The redness of red, the painness of pain - experience's irreducible atoms.

## What It's Like To Be

Mary knows everything about color vision. Wavelengths, neurons, processing. But she's lived in a black-white room. When she sees red for the first time, does she learn something new?

L1: Ouch! Yum! Pretty!
L2: Soul's sensations
L3: Mental properties
L4: Epiphenomena
L5: What-it's-like-ness
L6: Private language?
L7: Socially constructed
L8: Information states
L9: [Invalid question]

The hard problem: explain why there's something it's like to see red. Not how vision works, but why it feels like anything.
