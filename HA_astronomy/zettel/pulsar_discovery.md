# Pulsar Discovery

## Core Insight
Jocelyn Bell's "little green men" signals turned out to be city-sized stars spinning hundreds of times per second - the universe's most precise clocks, keeping time better than atomic clocks.

In 1967, graduate student Jocelyn Bell noticed odd signals in radio telescope data: pulses every 1.33 seconds, precise to microseconds. The team jokingly labeled them LGM (Little Green Men) before realizing they'd discovered something profound. These pulsars are neutron stars - stellar cores compressed beyond white dwarf density until protons and electrons merge into neutrons.

A sugar-cube of neutron star weighs 100 million tons. They spin rapidly (conservation of angular momentum from stellar collapse) with magnetic fields a trillion times Earth's. Radio beams shoot from magnetic poles; when the beam sweeps past Earth, we see a pulse - a cosmic lighthouse. Some pulsars spin 700 times per second, their surfaces moving at 20% light speed. Their stability rivals atomic clocks, making them tools for testing general relativity, detecting gravitational waves, and potentially navigating spacecraft. Nature's most extreme physics laboratories were hiding in radio static.
