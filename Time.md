Abstract
This paper explores the subjectivity and diversity of time experience among individuals from a cognitive psychological perspective. We propose a novel hypothesis that the human brain operates similarly to large language models (LLMs) and that each individual's brain has a unique "clock" that determines the minimum perceived duration of time. We argue that the subjective experience of time is proportional to the ratio of these individual clock cycles. This hypothesis is consistent with Einstein's theory of relativity, which relates the speed of light to time perception. We discuss the implications of this hypothesis for understanding individual differences in time experience and propose future research directions to test and validate this theory.

Introduction
The subjective nature of time experience has long fascinated philosophers, scientists, and psychologists alike. While classical physics regarded time as absolute and constant, Einstein's theory of relativity demonstrated that time is relative and can be influenced by factors such as speed and gravity (Einstein, 1905). This revolutionary idea opened up new avenues for understanding the subjective experience of time.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in the development of large language models (LLMs), have provided novel insights into the workings of the human brain. LLMs are neural networks that can process and generate human-like language based on patterns learned from vast amounts of text data (Radford et al., 2019). The architecture and functioning of these models have been compared to the structure and operation of the human brain (Beni, 2021).

It is important to note that while the analogy between LLMs and the human brain is intriguing, there are significant differences between artificial and biological intelligence that must be considered. The brain clock hypothesis is not intended to suggest that the brain functions exactly like an LLM, but rather that some similar principles of information processing may be at play in both systems. We acknowledge that this is a speculative idea that requires rigorous empirical testing and validation.

Building upon these ideas, we propose a new hypothesis that aims to explain the individual differences in time experience. We suggest that the human brain operates similarly to LLMs and that each individual's brain has a unique "clock" that determines the minimum perceived duration of time. The subjective experience of time, we argue, is proportional to the ratio of these individual clock cycles. This hypothesis is consistent with Einstein's theory of relativity, which relates the speed of light to time perception.

The Brain as a Large Language Model
Recent research in artificial intelligence has led to the development of large language models (LLMs) that can process and generate human-like language (Radford et al., 2019). These models are based on deep neural networks that learn patterns and relationships from vast amounts of text data. The architecture of LLMs, consisting of interconnected nodes and layers, has been compared to the structure of the human brain (Beni, 2021).

We propose that the human brain operates in a manner similar to LLMs. Just as LLMs process and generate language based on learned patterns, the human brain processes and generates thoughts, perceptions, and behaviors based on learned associations and experiences. This idea is consistent with the connectionist view of the brain, which suggests that cognitive processes emerge from the interactions of interconnected neural networks (McClelland & Rumelhart, 1986).

While we propose some similarities between LLMs and the brain, we recognize that the analogy has limitations. The human brain is a far more complex and dynamic system than current AI models, with intricate interactions between multiple neural networks, neurotransmitter systems, and external stimuli. The brain also has the capacity for subjective experiences, consciousness, and self-awareness, which are not yet understood or replicable in artificial systems. Therefore, the LLM analogy should be considered a simplified model for exploring certain aspects of cognitive processing, rather than a complete theory of brain function.

The Brain Clock Hypothesis
Building upon the idea of the brain as an information processing system, we propose the "brain clock" hypothesis to explain individual differences in time perception. We suggest that each individual's brain has a unique "clock" composed of multiple, hierarchically organized neural oscillators that determine the subjective flow of time (Allman et al., 2014; Gu et al., 2015). These oscillators operate at various frequencies, from slow delta waves to fast gamma waves, and their coordinated activity creates a temporal framework for cognitive processes (Wiener & Kanai, 2016).

The subjective experience of time, we argue, emerges from the integrated output of these oscillatory networks, which are modulated by factors such as attention, emotion, and memory (Matthews & Meck, 2016). The "speed" of an individual's brain clock, therefore, is determined by the dominant frequencies and coupling patterns of their neural oscillators, which may be influenced by genetic, developmental, and environmental factors (Allman & Meck, 2012).

Importantly, we do not propose that the brain clock is a single, fixed entity, but rather a dynamic system that can be accelerated or decelerated by various cognitive and neurophysiological factors. For example, the "attentional gate" model suggests that attention can modulate the flow of temporal information, effectively speeding up or slowing down subjective time depending on the allocation of attentional resources (Zakay & Block, 1995). Similarly, emotionally salient or novel stimuli may increase arousal and accelerate neural oscillations, resulting in a subjective lengthening of time (Droit-Volet & Meck, 2007). These factors, along with others such as working memory load, dopamine levels, and physical activity, can dynamically influence the speed and rhythmicity of the brain clock networks.

Relativity Theory and Time Perception
The brain clock hypothesis is inspired by Einstein's theory of relativity, which challenged the notion of absolute time. While the physical principles of relativity operate at cosmic scales, we propose that analogous phenomena may occur in the subjective domain of human time perception. In this view, the speed of an individual's brain clock can be likened to the relative velocity of an object, with faster neural oscillations corresponding to a slower subjective flow of time. This is conceptually similar to the time dilation effect predicted by special relativity, where time slows down for objects moving at high velocities relative to a stationary observer (Einstein, 1905).

It is crucial to clarify that we are not proposing a direct, quantitative mapping between physical relativity and subjective time dilation. The brain operates at vastly smaller scales and slower velocities than the relativistic domain. Moreover, the neural mechanisms underlying time perception are complex and multifaceted, involving interactions between multiple cognitive processes and neurophysiological systems. The relativity analogy is intended as a heuristic model to highlight the subjective and context-dependent nature of temporal experience, rather than a literal application of Einstein's theory to the brain.

4.1 The Big Bang of Life and the Start of the Brain Clock
We can consider the moment when an embryo is formed as the beginning of life. It can be assumed that the brain clock starts ticking at this point. This event can be seen as the origin of time for each individual, much like the Big Bang of the universe. From this perspective, the flow of subjective time has a unique history for each person and may have a different meaning than objective time. Just as we count the age of the universe, we can view an individual's subjective time as a journey starting from the Big Bang of life. This opens up new horizons for thinking about the relationship between human existence and time.

4.2 The Possibility of Brain Clock Overclocking
The brain clock operates at a unique speed for each individual, but it is not fixed and can be altered by various factors. This can be compared to overclocking a computer's CPU. Exploring the potential factors that can accelerate or decelerate the brain clock can be an important clue to understanding the variability of subjective time experience.

Some possible methods for overclocking the brain clock include:
(1) Drugs: Stimulants, neuroenhancers, and certain drugs can increase the speed of neural transmission and accelerate the brain's information processing speed.
(2) Meditation: Certain meditation techniques, such as mindfulness meditation, can alter time perception and make subjective time flow more slowly.
(3) Extreme situations: Life-threatening crises or intense emotional experiences can subjectively stretch the perception of a moment.
(4) Brain stimulation: Stimulating specific areas of the brain with techniques like transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can change time perception.

Although the possibility of brain clock overclocking is still hypothetical, it shows that subjective time can change dynamically. Empirical exploration of this idea can broaden our understanding of the complexity and diversity of time experience.

Implications and Future Directions
The brain clock hypothesis has important implications for understanding individual differences in time experience. If validated, this theory could provide a neurocognitive basis for the subjective nature of time perception. It could also shed light on the mechanisms underlying temporal processing deficits in mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia (Allman & Meck, 2012).

Moreover, the brain clock hypothesis may have implications for understanding and treating various clinical conditions that involve distortions of time perception, such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease (Allman & Meck, 2012; Fontes et al., 2016; Vogel et al., 2018). If abnormalities in neural oscillations or network coordination underlie these temporal processing deficits, targeted interventions that modulate brain rhythms, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or neurofeedback training, could potentially alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life (Grondin, 2010; Wiener et al., 2018).

Future research should aim to test and validate the brain clock hypothesis using empirical methods. One approach could be to use neuroimaging techniques, such as electroencephalography (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to measure brain activity during temporal processing tasks. If individual differences in brain clock speed can be detected and correlated with subjective time perception, this would provide strong support for the hypothesis.

In addition to neuroimaging, future studies could employ electrophysiological techniques, such as electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG), to directly measure neural oscillations and their relationship to subjective time perception (Kononowicz & Van Rijn, 2015; Wiener & Kanai, 2016). These methods could provide high temporal resolution data on the dynamics of brain clock networks and how they are modulated by cognitive and contextual factors.

Another important direction for future research is to investigate the development and plasticity of brain clock mechanisms across the lifespan. Studies have shown that time perception abilities change with age, with children and older adults typically exhibiting less precise and more variable temporal judgments compared to young adults (Allman & Meck, 2012; Turgeon et al., 2016). Longitudinal studies tracking the maturation and aging of brain clock networks, as well as their relationship to cognitive and behavioral outcomes, could provide valuable insights into the ontogeny and variability of temporal processing.

Another avenue for future research is to investigate the factors that influence brain clock speed. Genetic, environmental, and experiential factors may all play a role in determining an individual's brain clock speed. Understanding these factors could provide insights into the development and plasticity of temporal processing mechanisms.

Conclusion
In this paper, we have proposed a new hypothesis to explain individual differences in time experience. We suggest that the human brain operates similarly to large language models and that each individual's brain has a unique "clock" that determines the minimum perceived duration of time. The subjective experience of time, we argue, is proportional to the ratio of these individual clock cycles. This hypothesis is consistent with Einstein's theory of relativity and provides a theoretical framework for understanding the subjective nature of time perception.

While the brain clock hypothesis is still speculative and requires empirical validation, it offers a promising framework for integrating insights from neuroscience, psychology, and physics to better understand the enigmatic nature of time perception. By proposing a neural basis for individual differences in subjective time experience, this hypothesis opens up new avenues for research and theoretical development.

The brain clock hypothesis has important implications for understanding individual differences in time experience and temporal processing deficits in mental health conditions. Future research should aim to test and validate this hypothesis using empirical methods and investigate the factors that influence brain clock speed. By integrating insights from artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, and theoretical physics, we can deepen our understanding of the mysterious and subjective nature of time.

Ultimately, the study of subjective time perception is not only a fascinating scientific endeavor but also a deeply humanistic one. Our sense of time is intimately tied to our sense of self, our memories, and our experiences of the world around us. By unraveling the mysteries of the brain clock, we may gain not only a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying temporal cognition but also a richer appreciation of the diversity and subjectivity of human experience.
