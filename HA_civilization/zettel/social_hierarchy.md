# Social Hierarchy

## Core Insight
Hierarchy is civilization's solution to the coordination problem - creating pyramids of power from egalitarian apes.

Our primate ancestors had hierarchies, but they were personal, physical, immediate. The alpha dominated through strength. Human hierarchies are abstract, symbolic, nested. A physically weak king commands mighty warriors through pure symbol-power.

Hierarchy scales. You can't coordinate a million equals, but you can coordinate ten who each coordinate ten who each coordinate ten. Suddenly, million-person projects become possible. Pyramids, both social and physical.

But hierarchies also concentrate power, creating inequality as a feature, not a bug. Every civilization trades fairness for functionality. We accept that some command and others obey because the alternative is chaos.
