# Proper Motion

## Core Insight
Stars aren't fixed - they move across the sky over centuries, revealing the galaxy's dynamics through patient observation and proving the "fixed stars" are fellow travelers in cosmic motion.

Ancient astronomers called them "fixed stars" versus "wandering stars" (planets). But stars move - just slowly. Proper motion is a star's angular movement across the sky, measured in arcseconds per year. Barnard's Star races along at 10.4"/year - crossing a full Moon diameter in 180 years. Most stars move much slower.

Edmund Halley discovered proper motion in 1718 by comparing star positions to ancient catalogs. Stars had shifted. This proved stars were objects at different distances, not lights on a sphere. Combined with radial velocity (from Doppler shift), proper motion gives full 3D stellar motion. The Sun orbits the galaxy at 230 km/s, but nearby stars share this motion, so relative velocities are smaller. Hipparcos and Gaia satellites measured proper motions for billions of stars, revealing the galaxy's rotation, stellar streams from disrupted clusters, and hypervelocity stars ejected from the galactic center. The "fixed" stars dance - we just needed centuries to notice.
