# End of Economics

## Core Insight
Economics might engineer its own obsolescence - solving scarcity so completely that allocation becomes irrelevant, transcending the very problem it exists to solve.

Imagine true abundance. Molecular assemblers creating anything from raw atoms. Fusion providing limitless energy. AI solving all technical problems. Automation producing without human labor. Suddenly, the economic problem - how to allocate scarce resources - vanishes.

What remains? Without scarcity, no prices. Without prices, no markets. Without markets, no economics as we know it. The entire discipline, from supply and demand to GDP, becomes as relevant as alchemy after chemistry.

But new problems emerge. If anyone can have anything, what do we want? If work is unnecessary, how do we find purpose? If competition for resources ends, what drives progress? The economic problem solved reveals deeper existential problems.

Perhaps economics transforms rather than ends. From allocating scarce goods to allocating abundant meaning. From distributing resources to distributing purpose. From managing competition to managing cooperation. From growth to flourishing.

Or perhaps economics is eternal. Even with material abundance, time remains scarce. Attention stays limited. Status stays positional. New scarcities emerge at higher levels. The game continues with different tokens.

The paradox: economics dreams of solving scarcity, but solving scarcity would end economics. We're using economics to make economics obsolete. Success is suicide. The discipline's greatest triumph would be its own irrelevance.
