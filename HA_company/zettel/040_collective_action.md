# Collective Action

## Core Insight
Companies are humanity's most successful collective action technology - enabling thousands to coordinate toward shared goals, achieving what no individual could imagine alone.

The miracle is coordination at scale. Getting two people to agree is hard. Getting thousands to march together should be impossible. Yet companies do it daily through hierarchy, culture, incentives, purpose. Individual chaos becomes collective coherence.

This isn't just cooperation but transformation. In companies, individuals transcend themselves. The accountant contributes to rocket launches. The engineer enables global communication. Personal work connects to civilizational projects. We become more through merger.

But collective action creates collective shadows. Groupthink suppresses dissent. Diffusion of responsibility enables evil. "Just following orders" excuses individual conscience. The same force that builds wonders builds horrors. Power requires wisdom.
