# Divergent Thinking: Creative Spread

**Core Concept**: Creativity requires thinking outward in many directions rather than converging on one answer.

## One-Line Definition
The ability to generate multiple, unusual solutions by relaxing mental constraints.

## Simple Mental Model
Like water finding all possible paths down a hill versus a train on tracks. Creative minds explore; convergent minds optimize.

## Key Mechanism
1. Suppress first obvious answer
2. Reduce cognitive inhibition
3. Make remote associations
4. Generate quantity over quality

## Practical Example
"Uses for a brick": Building (obvious) → workout weight → smartphone stand → paint palette → door stop → murder weapon → theater prop. Each idea spawns more.

## Common Misconception
Creativity is about finding THE right answer. Actually, it's about generating MANY possible answers, most "wrong" but some revolutionary.
