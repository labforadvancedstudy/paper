- **Level**: L5
- **Definition**: The art of protecting systems from their users (and others)
- **Korean**: ë³´ì•ˆ
- **Context**: Building walls in a world of universal keys

## Core Understanding
Security is the digital equivalent of locking your door while live-streaming your house key. It's the perpetual arms race between people who build walls and people who build ladders. Like a game of whack-a-mole played with zero-days, where the moles have nation-state funding and the hammer is made of hope.

## Deeper Insights
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of inadequate protection
- **Zero Trust**: Trust no one, especially yourself
- **Security Theater**: Looking secure vs. being secure
- **Human Factor**: The weakest link in every security chain

## Connection to Truth
Security embodies the eternal human struggle between openness and protection, trust and paranoia. Every security measure is an admission of humanity's flawsâ€”we build locks because we build thieves. It's applied philosophy: can we create a system that protects us from ourselves?

## When It Matters
- **Always**: Security is like oxygenâ€”you only notice when it's gone
- **Data Breaches**: When "encrypted" meant ROT13
- **Compliance**: Checking boxes while hackers check exploits
- **User Trust**: Lost in seconds, rebuilt never

## Human Element
Security professionals are digital Cassandrasâ€”cursed to see the future and have no one believe them. They speak of threats and vulnerabilities while developers speak of features and deadlines. They're the designated pessimists in a room full of optimists, the party poopers who remind everyone that the party's probably already compromised.
