# Logic and the Foundations of Truth

## Core Insight
Logic is the scaffolding of mathematical truth - the rules by which we distinguish valid reasoning from wishful thinking.

## Content
Before mathematics can talk about numbers or shapes, it must establish how to think. Logic provides the grammar of mathematical thought.

Propositional logic starts simple:
- Statements are true or false
- AND, OR, NOT combine statements
- If-then captures implication
- Truth tables verify arguments

Predicate logic adds power:
- Variables range over domains
- ∀ (for all) makes universal claims
- ∃ (exists) makes existence claims
- Predicates express properties

But then Gödel shattered the dream:
- First Incompleteness: consistent systems can't prove all truths
- Second Incompleteness: consistent systems can't prove their own consistency
- Truth transcends provability

Logic revealed paradoxes:
- Russell's paradox: set of all sets that don't contain themselves
- Liar paradox: "This statement is false"
- Berry paradox: "The smallest number not definable in under 100 words"

Modern developments:
- Modal logic: necessity and possibility
- Intuitionistic logic: constructive mathematics
- Paraconsistent logic: handling contradictions
- Homotopy type theory: logic as space

Logic isn't just about truth - it's about the limits of what can be said about truth.
