# Time Dilation

## Core Insight
Time dilation transforms interstellar travel from a journey through space into a fracturing of shared time - travelers age slowly while civilizations they left behind race through centuries.

Einstein's gift and curse: the faster you go, the slower time passes for you. At significant fractions of light speed, the universe's clock and your clock disagree dramatically.

The math is merciless:
- At 90% light speed: 2.3x time dilation
- At 99% light speed: 7x time dilation  
- At 99.9% light speed: 22x time dilation
- At 99.99% light speed: 70x time dilation

Real implications:
- Journey to Proxima at 99% c: 6 months for you, 4.3 years for Earth
- Journey to galactic center: 40 years for you, 26,000 years for Earth
- Return trips mean everyone you knew is dead
- Civilizations rise and fall while you're in transit

This creates the "interstellar orphan" problem: travelers become disconnected from their origin in time, not just space. You can go to the stars, but you can never truly go home - home won't exist anymore.

Time dilation makes interstellar civilization less like sailing between islands and more like jumping between epochs.
