# Barter

## Core Insight
The original market: direct exchange of goods without money - revealing value is relational, not absolute.

Before money, there was "my fish for your fruit." Barter is economics stripped bare - pure want meeting want. It reveals the fundamental truth: value exists only in the space between desires.

Barter's challenges:
- **Double coincidence** - I must want what you have AND you must want what I have
- **Indivisibility** - can't trade half a cow for bread
- **Storage** - fresh fish won't wait for harvest
- **Valuation** - how many chickens per goat?
- **Transportation** - must bring goods to trade

Yet barter teaches profound lessons:
- Value is negotiated, not fixed
- Trade requires trust
- Specialization has limits
- Money solves real problems
- Relationships matter in exchange

Modern barter persists:
- Children trading cards
- Services swapped between friends
- International countertrade
- Post-disaster economies
- Underground economies

Barter is economics' bedrock. Every monetary transaction is just barter with extra steps. Understanding barter means understanding that all value is ultimately about human desires meeting.
