# Cepheid Variables

## Core Insight
Cepheid stars pulsate with periods directly related to their luminosity - nature's gift of standard candles that let us measure distances to galaxies and discover the universe is expanding.

Henrietta Leavitt discovered in 1912 that Cepheid variables in the Small Magellanic Cloud showed a pattern: brighter ones pulsed slower. This period-luminosity relation was revolutionary. Measure a Cepheid's pulsation period, and you know its true brightness. Compare to apparent brightness, and distance follows.

Cepheids pulsate because they're in an unstable phase of stellar evolution. Helium ionization in their outer layers creates a heat engine. The star swells, cools, contracts, heats, and repeats. Periods range from days to months. Classical Cepheids can be seen in galaxies 100 million light-years away. Edwin Hubble used Cepheids to prove "spiral nebulae" were external galaxies, expanding our universe from one galaxy to millions. He then used Cepheid distances with redshifts to discover cosmic expansion. These pulsating stars, dismissed as peculiar variables, became astronomy's most important distance indicators. Sometimes nature provides exactly the tool we need.
