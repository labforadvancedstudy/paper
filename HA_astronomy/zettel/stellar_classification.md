# Stellar Classification

## Core Insight
Annie Jump Cannon's "Oh Be A Fine Girl/Guy, Kiss Me" encodes a temperature sequence that organizes stellar chaos into physical understanding - spectral lines reveal stellar nature.

In the early 1900s, Harvard "computers" (women astronomers) classified hundreds of thousands of stellar spectra. Annie Jump Cannon recognized the key: spectral type indicates temperature, not composition. O stars (>30,000K) show ionized helium. B stars (10,000-30,000K) show neutral helium. A stars show strong hydrogen. F, G (like our Sun), K show increasing metal lines. M stars (<3,500K) show molecular bands.

This OBAFGKM sequence, with decimal subdivisions (G2 for the Sun), organizes stellar diversity. Combined with luminosity classes (I=supergiant, V=main sequence), it creates the MK system. A star's spectral type plus luminosity class tells its temperature, size, mass, age, and fate. "G2V" completely describes a sun-like star. What began as spectral stamp collecting became stellar physics. Every star tells its story in light - we just needed to learn the language.
