# Art Ethics

## Core Insight
The impossible separation - where aesthetic and ethical intertwine, forcing recognition that how we make, show, and see art carries moral weight beyond pure form.

Ethical dimensions multiply:
- Representation (who/how depicted)
- Production (labor conditions)
- Materials (environmental impact)
- Display (access/exclusion)
- Ownership (cultural property)

Classic dilemmas:
- Riefenstahl's beautiful fascism
- Separated art/artist?
- Suffering for art justified?
- Censorship vs. freedom
- Moral instruction role?

Contemporary issues:
- Cultural appropriation
- Consent in participation
- AI attribution
- NFT environmental cost
- Precarious art labor

Institutional ethics:
- Repatriation demands
- Donor source scrutiny
- Board diversity
- Worker treatment
- Community responsibility

Market ethics:
- Price manipulation
- Authentication fraud
- Money laundering
- Tax avoidance
- Speculation damage

Artist responsibilities:
- Subject treatment
- Assistant crediting
- Environmental consideration
- Community impact
- Power acknowledgment

Viewer ethics:
- Complicity questions
- Boycott decisions
- Interpretation responsibility
- Sharing permissions
- Support choices

No easy answers:
- Context matters
- Power differentials key
- Intentions insufficient
- Consequences count
- Dialogue necessary

Ethics in art isn't external addition but intrinsic dimension. Every choice ethical. Pretending otherwise itself ethical position. Art shapes world; world-shaping carries responsibility.
