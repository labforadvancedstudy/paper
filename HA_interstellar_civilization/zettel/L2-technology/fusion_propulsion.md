# Fusion Propulsion

## Core Insight
Fusion propulsion represents humanity's attempt to harness stellar power for motion - turning the same process that lights stars into thrust that could carry us between them.

Chemical rockets are fireworks. Nuclear rockets are better. But fusion? Fusion is how the universe says "this is how you really move." It's the difference between rowing and sailing - suddenly you have real power.

The promise:
- Specific impulse: 100,000+ seconds (vs chemical's 450)
- Exhaust velocity: 3-5% speed of light
- Fuel: Deuterium/Helium-3 (relatively abundant)
- Power: Enough to sustain life support indefinitely
- Acceleration: Constant thrust for years

Current fusion concepts:
- Magnetic confinement (tokamak in space)
- Inertial confinement (pellet explosions)
- Magnetic target fusion (hybrid approach)
- Bussard ramjet (collect fuel while moving)
- Direct fusion drive (thrust and power together)

The reality: We can barely make fusion work on Earth in building-sized reactors. Making it work in spacecraft, reliably, for decades? That's the challenge. But it's the minimum technology for serious interstellar travel.

Without fusion, the stars remain effectively unreachable. With it, they're merely very far away.
