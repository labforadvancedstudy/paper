# Breathing

## Core Insight
The automatic rhythm that stops when you think about it - life's most fundamental paradox of conscious control over unconscious necessity.

You're doing it right now. In, out. In, out. But the moment I mentioned it, you became aware. Now you're controlling it. Try to stop - you can't for long. This is life's grip on you.

Breathing is where voluntary meets involuntary. You can hold your breath (voluntary), but not forever (involuntary). You can breathe fast or slow, but you can't choose not to breathe. It's life's non-negotiable contract.

Every breath exchanges you with the world. The oxygen that enters becomes part of you. The carbon dioxide that leaves was you. You are literally exchanging matter with the universe 20,000 times a day. You are not separate from your environment - you are a process of exchange with it.

The rhythm varies: fast when excited, slow when calm, stopped when shocked. It's life's metronome, marking time not in seconds but in exchanges. A life is measured in breaths, not years.
