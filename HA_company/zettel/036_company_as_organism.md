# Company as Organism

## Core Insight
Companies aren't like organisms - they ARE organisms, displaying metabolism, homeostasis, reproduction, and adaptation, just substrate-independent from biology.

The parallels run deep. Companies metabolize resources into products. They maintain homeostasis through feedback systems. They reproduce through spinoffs and franchises. They adapt to environmental changes. They're born, grow, mature, die. Life patterns repeat in corporate form.

But companies are strange organisms. Distributed across geography. Composed of conscious components (humans). Able to merge, split, transform dramatically. They shed and acquire organs (divisions) at will. They hibernate (bankruptcy protection) and resurrect.

Seeing companies as organisms changes everything. Health matters more than size. Resilience matters more than efficiency. Evolution matters more than planning. The question shifts from "How do we manage?" to "How do we cultivate life?"
