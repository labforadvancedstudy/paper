# Ideology

## Core Insight
The stories societies tell themselves to explain why things are the way they are - and why they must stay that way.

Ideology is consciousness false and true simultaneously. False because it obscures power relations (the rich deserve wealth because they work harder). True because people living within ideology make it real through their actions (working harder to become rich).

Every society runs on ideology: divine right of kings, manifest destiny, meritocracy, progress. These aren't lies exactly - they're organizing myths that coordinate behavior. The American Dream doesn't have to be achievable to motivate millions to try.

The genius of ideology is its invisibility. Fish don't see water; we don't see our ideologies. They feel like common sense, natural law, "just how things are." Only when ideologies clash do we glimpse their constructedness.
