# The Explanatory Gap

Between objective and subjective lies an abyss.

We can explain:
- How eyes detect photons
- How neurons fire patterns
- How brain processes color

We cannot explain:
- Why there's something it's like
- How firing becomes feeling
- Where experience emerges

This gap might be unbridgeable.
