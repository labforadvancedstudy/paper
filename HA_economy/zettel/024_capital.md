# Capital

## Core Insight
Accumulated power to produce: when past labor becomes future capacity - the economic time machine.

Capital is crystalized potential. It's resources saved and transformed into productive capacity - machines, buildings, patents, brands. Capital is how the past empowers the future.

Capital forms:
- **Physical capital** - factories, equipment, infrastructure
- **Human capital** - skills, knowledge, experience
- **Financial capital** - money to acquire other capitals
- **Social capital** - relationships, trust, reputation
- **Intellectual capital** - patents, processes, data

Capital dynamics:
- Accumulation (saving → investing)
- Depreciation (wearing out, obsolescence)
- Returns (capital generates income)
- Concentration (capital attracts capital)
- Destruction (creative and otherwise)

The profound truth: capital is congealed labor. Every machine embodies thousands of hours of human work. Capital lets dead labor amplify living labor.

The capital controversy: who should own the means of production? How much return should capital earn versus labor? This question divides economic philosophies and shapes civilizations.
