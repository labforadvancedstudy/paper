# Rocket Engine

## Core Insight
A controlled bomb that directs its violence in one direction - the machine that turns chemical potential energy into thrust through the elegant brutality of combustion at extreme conditions.

A rocket engine is deceptively simple in principle: mix fuel with oxidizer, ignite, and let the hot gas escape through a carefully shaped nozzle. But the engineering reality is a masterpiece of materials science, fluid dynamics, and thermodynamics pushed to their limits.

The basic anatomy:
- Injector: Mixes propellants in precise ratios
- Combustion chamber: Where hell happens (3000°C+)
- Throat: The choke point that sets mass flow
- Nozzle: Expands gas to maximize exhaust velocity
- Cooling system: Keeps it all from melting

Critical engineering challenges:
- Combustion instability (can destroy engine in milliseconds)
- Cooling the chamber (regenerative, film, ablative)
- Injector design (proper mixing without hot spots)
- Nozzle optimization (sea level vs vacuum)
- Throttling capability (harder than it sounds)
- Reusability (most engines designed for one use)

Engine types reveal different solutions:
- Pressure-fed: Simple but heavy tanks
- Pump-fed: Complex but efficient
- Staged combustion: Maximum performance
- Expander cycle: Elegant simplicity
- Electric pump: Modern hybrid approach

The numbers are staggering: Chamber pressures exceeding 200 atmospheres, exhaust velocities over 4 km/s, power outputs in gigawatts. All while weighing as little as possible and (increasingly) being reusable.

A rocket engine is humanity's most violent peaceful machine.
