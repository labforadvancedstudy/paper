# Anthropic Principle

## Core Insight
The universe's constants are precisely tuned for life - either by cosmic coincidence or observer necessity.

Change any fundamental constant slightly and life becomes impossible. Strong force 2% stronger? No hydrogen, no stars, no life. 2% weaker? No elements beyond hydrogen. Electromagnetic force slightly different? No stable atoms. Cosmological constant larger? Universe expands too fast for galaxies.

The precision is absurd. The cosmological constant is fine-tuned to 120 decimal places. It's like randomly throwing a dart and hitting a specific atom in the observable universe. By chance? Design? Or something else?

The weak anthropic principle says we observe a life-friendly universe because we couldn't observe any other kind. Dead universes have no observers. It's survivor bias on cosmic scale - we're here because here is where observers can be.

The strong version is wilder: the universe MUST create observers. Perhaps consciousness is not accidental but necessary. Perhaps universes without observers don't fully exist. Perhaps we're how the universe becomes real to itself.

The unsettling implication: our existence might be fundamentally necessary rather than coincidental.
