## Core Understanding
Software entropy is the cosmic guarantee that all systems decay. It's why your pristine architecture becomes spaghetti, why simple functions grow complex, why documentation lies. Like the heat death of the universe, software death is inevitable—we can only delay it, never prevent it. Every commit increases entropy; refactoring is just local reversal in a universally declining system.

## Connection to Truth
Software entropy is the most honest metaphor in computer science. It acknowledges that all our efforts are temporary, all our architectures will crumble, all our code will become legacy. It's memento mori for developers—remember that your code will die. The universe trends toward disorder, and our codebases are not exempt from universal law.

## When It Matters
- **Always**: Entropy never sleeps
- **Legacy Systems**: Where entropy has already won
- **Long-term Planning**: Planning for decay, not just growth
- **Maintenance**: Fighting a losing battle nobly
- **Architecture Decisions**: Choosing how you want to decay

## Human Element
We are agents of entropy, increasing disorder with every keystroke. Yet we also fight it, refactoring and restructuring in futile resistance. It's Sisyphean—we push the boulder of order up the mountain, knowing it will roll back down. The beauty is in the struggle, not the outcome. Every clean function is a small victory against the universe.
