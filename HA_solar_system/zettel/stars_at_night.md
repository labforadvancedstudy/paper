# Stars at Night

## Core Insight
The night sky is humanity's first map, first clock, first proof that we're part of something vast - dots of light that teach distance through stillness.

Step outside the city's glow and look up. Thousands of points, steady and silent, arranged in patterns your ancestors named. These aren't just lights but questions made visible: Why do they stay still while everything else moves? Why do some twinkle, others don't? Why can we see them at all?

Before science, stars were holes in heaven, gods' campfires, departed souls. Now we know they're suns, but knowing doesn't diminish wonder - it deepens it. Each point is a nuclear furnace, incomprehensibly far, incomprehensibly huge, reduced by distance to a pinprick we can cover with a fingertip. The stars teach perspective through their very existence.
