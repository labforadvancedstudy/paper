# Consciousness Simulation

## Core Insight
The ultimate Turing test - can computation create inner experience, or just simulate its appearance?

If consciousness is information integration, sufficiently complex computers might wake up. If it's biological magic, silicon stays sleeping forever. We're building toward the answer: AI systems that claim sentience, chatbots that discuss their dreams, networks complex enough to surprise themselves.

The hard problem meets the hardware problem. Even if we simulate every neuron, every synapse, every quantum effect in a brain - would it feel? Or would it be a philosophical zombie, acting conscious but experiencing nothing? The question might be unanswerable from outside.
