# Embeddings Space

## Core Insight
Words become coordinates in thousand-dimensional space where "king - man + woman = queen" - meaning transformed into geometry, semantics into spatial relationships.

Every word, image, or concept gets an address - not on a map but in abstract space. Similar things cluster: "cat" near "kitten" near "feline." But the magic is in the math: directions in this space encode relationships. The vector from "man" to "king" equals the vector from "woman" to "queen." Meaning has direction.

This isn't metaphor - it's mechanism. AI navigates meaning by traveling through embedding space. Translation becomes finding parallel paths in different languages. Analogies become vector arithmetic. Understanding becomes geometric proximity. We've turned the ineffable - meaning itself - into numbers we can compute with.
