# Habitable Zone

## Core Insight
The Goldilocks zone where water stays liquid defines where life as we know it can exist - but this simple concept hides complex realities about what makes worlds livable.

The habitable zone seems simple: the distance from a star where water neither freezes nor boils. For our Sun, roughly Venus to Mars. Earth sits perfectly placed. But Venus is in the zone and hellish. Mars is in the zone and frozen. The naive habitable zone concept misses crucial factors: atmospheric pressure, greenhouse gases, magnetic fields, plate tectonics, moon stabilization.

The zone moves over time - stars brighten as they age, pushing the zone outward. It varies by planet type - a massive atmosphere extends the zone. Tidal locking creates permanent day/night sides with different zones. Subsurface oceans exist far outside traditional zones. The habitable zone concept remains useful for finding potentially living worlds, but habitability is more about the complex interplay of factors than simple distance. Life is pickier than we thought, yet more creative in where it might exist.
