# Great Red Spot

## Core Insight
Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a storm larger than Earth that has raged for centuries - a persistent vortex that reveals how atmospheric dynamics can create near-permanent features.

The Great Red Spot defies earthly experience. This anticyclonic storm, twice Earth's diameter, has persisted at least 400 years (since first telescopic observations). Its red color remains mysterious - perhaps complex organic molecules created by ultraviolet light, or phosphorus dredged from deep atmosphere. The storm towers eight kilometers above surrounding clouds, spinning counterclockwise every six days.

How does a storm last centuries? Jupiter lacks land to disrupt flow. The spot exists between opposing jet streams that confine and energize it. It feeds on smaller storms, absorbing their energy. Yet it's shrinking - once three Earths wide, now less than two. We're watching atmospheric persistence and evolution in real-time. The Great Red Spot shows that some patterns, once established, can outlive civilizations. It was there before Newton, and might outlast humanity.
