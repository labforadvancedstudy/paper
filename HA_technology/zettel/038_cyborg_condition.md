# Cyborg Condition

## Core Insight
We've always been cyborgs - the moment we picked up sticks, we became human-tool assemblages. Technology isn't what we use but what we are.

The cyborg isn't future but history. Clothes are thermal regulation technology. Language is cognitive enhancement. Writing is external memory. We've been merging with technology since before we were human - it's what made us human.

The boundaries are fictional. Where does the blind person end and the cane begin? The driver and the car? The thinker and their notebook? Function creates unity. We're already distributed systems pretending to be individuals.

Resistance is nostalgia. There was never a pure human state to return to. We co-evolved with our tools from the start. The question isn't whether to be cyborgs but what kind - conscious or unconscious, empowered or enslaved.
