# Social Loafing: Diffused Effort

**Core Concept**: People work less hard in groups when individual contribution can't be identified.

## One-Line Definition
The larger the group, the less each person pulls - responsibility dissolves in the crowd.

## Simple Mental Model
Like a tug-of-war - one-on-one, you pull with all strength. Add teammates, each person secretly slacks, thinking others will compensate.

## Key Mechanism
1. Individual effort becomes invisible
2. Responsibility diffuses across group
3. Motivation decreases
4. Free-riding on others' work

## Practical Example
Group project: five students, two do 80% of work. Applause: the bigger the audience, the quieter each person claps. "Someone else will handle it."

## Common Misconception
Social loafing is conscious laziness. Often it's unconscious - people genuinely believe they're contributing equally while measurably doing less.
