# Acid-Base Theory

## Core Insight
Acids and bases are proton donors and acceptors - a dance of H+ ions that governs much of aqueous chemistry.

Arrhenius said acids make H+, bases make OH-. Brønsted-Lowry went deeper: acids donate protons, bases accept them. Lewis went deepest: acids accept electron pairs, bases donate them. Each definition encompasses the previous, revealing deeper unity.

Water itself is amphoteric - acid and base simultaneously. In pure water, one in 10 million molecules is dissociated. This tiny fraction creates pH 7. Add acid, H+ increases, pH drops. Add base, H+ decreases, pH rises. Logarithmic scale makes huge ranges manageable.

Buffer systems resist pH change by equilibrium shifting. Blood maintains pH 7.4 through carbonic acid/bicarbonate buffering. Tiny deviation means death. Life exists in narrow pH windows, maintained by chemical equilibria.
