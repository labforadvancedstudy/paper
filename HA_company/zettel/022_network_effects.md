# Network Effects

## Core Insight
Network effects transform companies into gravitational wells - where each additional user increases value for all users, creating exponential growth and winner-take-all dynamics.

The telephone was useless with one user, revolutionary with millions. This pattern repeats: social networks, marketplaces, platforms. Value grows as n², where n is users. The thousand user is worth more than the first hundred combined.

Network effects create moats filled with mathematics. Competitors can't just build better products - they must overcome the incumbent's network value. Users won't switch to empty networks, no matter how superior. The first-mover advantage becomes insurmountable.

But networks are fragile. Value depends on user participation. If users leave en masse, collapse accelerates. MySpace to Facebook, Friendster to oblivion - network effects work both ways. The same force that builds empires destroys them.
