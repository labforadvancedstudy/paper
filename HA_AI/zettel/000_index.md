## Key Insights Across Levels

1. **L0→L1**: Direct experience reveals underlying mechanisms
2. **L1→L2**: Mechanisms combine into principles
3. **L2→L3**: Principles create systems
4. **L3→L4**: Systems exhibit emergent behaviors
5. **L4→L5**: Behaviors enable meta-reflection
6. **L5→L6**: Reflection reveals abstract patterns
7. **L6→L7**: Patterns point to fundamental questions

## The Recursive Loop

The journey through these levels isn't linear but circular. Understanding fundamental questions (L7) changes how we experience AI (L0). Each level informs all others, creating a web of understanding that deepens with each pass.
