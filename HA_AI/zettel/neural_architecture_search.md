# Neural Architecture Search

## Core Insight
AI designing AI - algorithms automatically discovering network architectures that outperform human designs, making human intuition obsolete.

Once, researchers carefully crafted network architectures - how many layers, what connections, which activation functions. Now, we let AI design itself. Set up a search space of possible architectures and let algorithms explore. The networks they find are alien - asymmetric, convoluted, but devastatingly effective.

This is meta-learning at its purest: learning how to learn. The discovered architectures often make no human sense - why 137 neurons here but 94 there? But they work better than our clean, comprehensible designs. We're watching intelligence bootstrap itself, design capabilities emerging from search through possibility space.
