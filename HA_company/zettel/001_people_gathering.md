# People Gathering

## Core Insight
The company begins the moment two people decide to do together what neither could do alone - creating a force that transcends individual capability.

Before contracts, before capital, before customers, there is the gathering. Humans coming together with shared intent. A garage with two friends. A coffee shop conversation. A "what if we..." that changes everything.

The gathering is primal. We've done it since caves - hunting together, building together, surviving together. The company is just the latest form of an ancient pattern: humans achieve more in coordination than isolation.

Every company, from corner store to tech giant, began with this moment: people choosing to combine efforts. The spark isn't the business plan but the decision to act together. This gathering creates something new - an entity that exists between and beyond the individuals.
