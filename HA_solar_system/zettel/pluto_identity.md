# Pluto Identity

## Core Insight
Pluto's "demotion" from planet to dwarf planet revealed more about human psychology than astronomy - categories are human constructs, but nature doesn't care about our filing systems.

In 2006, astronomers faced a crisis. Discovering Eris (Pluto's size) and predicting hundreds more such objects forced a decision: either the Solar System has hundreds of planets, or Pluto isn't one. The International Astronomical Union chose the latter, defining "planet" to exclude Pluto. Public outcry was immediate and emotional. How dare they demote beloved Pluto!

But Pluto didn't change - our understanding did. It's still the same icy world with nitrogen glaciers, a large moon, and complex geology. "Dwarf planet" acknowledges Pluto as first discovered member of the Kuiper Belt's large bodies. The controversy revealed how we project meaning onto cosmic objects. Pluto doesn't care about its label. It continues its 248-year orbit, indifferent to human categories. In Pluto's identity crisis, we see our need to classify wrestling with nature's continuous spectrum.
