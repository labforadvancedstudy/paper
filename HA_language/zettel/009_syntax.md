# Syntax

## Core Insight
The architecture of meaning - rules for combining words into larger structures.

## The Invisible Scaffolding

Syntax is why "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" feels grammatical but meaningless, while "Sleep ideas colorless furiously green" feels wrong. Structure matters.

Syntactic universals:
- **Hierarchical structure**: Not just word chains but nested trees
- **Recursion**: Sentences within sentences, infinitely
- **Movement**: Questions move words ("What did you see?")
- **Agreement**: Parts must match (she walks, not she walk)

Basic syntactic categories:
- Phrase (noun phrase, verb phrase)
- Clause (independent, dependent)  
- Sentence (simple, compound, complex)

The magic: Children master syntax without explicit instruction. Chomsky says we're born with syntax template - Universal Grammar.

Syntax varies wildly:
- English: Strict word order
- Russian: Free word order (cases mark roles)
- Chinese: No inflection, pure position
