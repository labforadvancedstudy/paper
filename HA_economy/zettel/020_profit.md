# Profit

## Core Insight
The surplus that makes tomorrow possible - when output exceeds input, growth begins.

Profit is the gap between cost and revenue, but it's really about creating more than you consume. It's the seed corn saved, the extra that enables expansion, the margin that allows risk-taking.

Profit enables:
- **Reinvestment** - profit becomes new capital
- **Buffer** - survival through bad times
- **Innovation** - resources for experiments
- **Reward** - return for risk taken
- **Signal** - showing what works

Profit perspectives:
- Worker: "That's value I created but didn't receive"
- Owner: "That's reward for risk and organization"
- Society: "That's resources for growth"
- Moralist: "That's excess that could help others"

The profound truth: without profit, there's only subsistence. Profit is what lifts economics beyond mere survival. It's accumulation that enables civilization's compound growth.

Yet profit has shadows - it can incentivize exploitation, environmental damage, inequality. The eternal question: how much profit is just?
