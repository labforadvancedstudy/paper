# Astrostatistics

## Core Insight
Modern astronomy drowns in data - billions of objects, trillions of measurements - requiring sophisticated statistics to find needles of discovery in cosmic haystacks of noise.

The era of looking through eyepieces at individual objects ended. Surveys like Sloan Digital Sky Survey catalog millions of galaxies. Gaia measures billions of star positions. LIGO analyzes continuous gravitational wave data streams. Finding signals requires advanced statistics. Machine learning classifies galaxy morphologies faster than any human. Bayesian inference extracts exoplanet parameters from noisy transit data.

Statistical challenges abound. Selection effects bias every observation - we see bright objects preferentially. Malmquist bias affects distance-limited samples. Eddington bias skews measurements near detection limits. Proper statistical treatment transforms marginal detections into discoveries. The Higgs boson required 5-sigma significance; astronomy often accepts 3-sigma. Period-finding algorithms reveal pulsars in radio noise. Correlation functions map cosmic web structure. Modern astronomy is as much about algorithms as telescopes. The universe hides its secrets in statistical whispers that only careful analysis reveals.
