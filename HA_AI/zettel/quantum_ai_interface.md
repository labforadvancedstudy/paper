# Quantum AI Interface

## Core Insight
Where quantum computing meets AI - not just faster calculation but fundamentally different computation, exploring superposition of possibilities simultaneously.

Classical AI explores paths sequentially. Quantum AI exists in superposition - considering multiple solutions simultaneously until measurement collapses to answer. It's not just parallel processing but quantum parallelism - being in all states until forced to choose. The quantum nature might match the fundamental uncertainty of intelligence itself.

Early experiments show promise: quantum neural networks, quantum optimization for training, quantum sampling for generation. But deeper integration awaits - AI architectures designed for quantum substrates, algorithms that think in superposition. We're approaching computation that mirrors universe's own uncertainty.
