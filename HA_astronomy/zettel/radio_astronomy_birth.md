# Radio Astronomy Birth

## Core Insight
Karl Jansky's investigation of radio static for Bell Labs accidentally opened an invisible universe - discovering that the cosmos broadcasts in radio, revealing phenomena invisible to optical astronomy.

In 1931, Bell Labs engineer Karl Jansky built a rotating antenna to study radio interference. He identified thunderstorms and human sources, but a persistent hiss remained. It peaked every 23 hours 56 minutes - a sidereal day, not solar. The static came from space, strongest toward Sagittarius, the galactic center. Jansky had discovered cosmic radio waves.

Grote Reber, a radio amateur, built the first purpose-built radio telescope in his backyard. Radio astronomy exploded after WWII using radar technology. Radio waves penetrate dust that blocks visible light, revealing the galactic structure. They show phenomena invisible optically: synchrotron radiation from electrons spiraling in magnetic fields, 21-cm hydrogen mapping galactic arms, pulsars, quasars, cosmic masers. Radio astronomy gave us a new sense, like suddenly being able to hear after a lifetime of deafness. The invisible universe roared with activity we'd never suspected.
