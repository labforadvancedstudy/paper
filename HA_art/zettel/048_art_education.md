# Art Education

## Core Insight
The paradox of teaching creativity - where institutions attempt to systematize the unsystematizable, producing artists through structures that art often exists to escape.

Art education models clash:
- Academy tradition (skills first)
- Bauhaus integration (art/craft/design)
- Black Mountain experiment (interdisciplinary)
- CalArts conceptual (critique heavy)
- YouTube university (self-directed)

What can be taught:
- Technical skills
- Historical knowledge
- Critical vocabulary
- Professional practices
- Network access

What can't be taught:
- Vision
- Urgency
- Authenticity
- Risk tolerance
- Timing

MFA debate rages:
- Necessary credential?
- Debt burden crushing?
- Homogenization risk?
- Network value real?
- Alternative paths valid?

Institutional critique ironic:
- Art schools produce art school art
- Critique becomes conformity
- Theory overshadows making
- Success narrowly defined
- Rebels become professors

Contemporary disruptions:
- Online skill sharing
- Mentorship programs
- Community workshops
- Artist-run schools
- Decolonized curricula

Hidden curriculum operates:
- Who belongs here?
- What references matter?
- Which languages spoken?
- Whose history taught?
- How success measured?

Yet transformation happens. Studios as laboratories. Peers as first audience. Time to experiment. Permission to fail. Sometimes magic.
