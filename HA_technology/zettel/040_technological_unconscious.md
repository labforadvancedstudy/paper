# Technological Unconscious

## Core Insight
The technological unconscious is the vast machinery of assumptions, infrastructures, and processes that shape our reality below the threshold of awareness - the disappeared background of modern existence.

Like Freud's unconscious but collective and external. Power grids assume centralization. Keyboards assume sequential input. Screens assume visual primacy. These shape thought and behavior more powerfully because they're invisible.

The unconscious isn't just infrastructure but ideology embedded in systems. Algorithms encode biases. Architectures embed power relations. Protocols prescribe possibilities. We live inside others' crystallized assumptions.

Revealing the technological unconscious is archaeology of the present. Why this plug shape? Why this data format? Why this interface metaphor? Each artifact contains fossilized decisions that constrain current choice. Liberation requires excavation.
