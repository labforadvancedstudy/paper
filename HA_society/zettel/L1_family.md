# Family

## Core Insight
The first social unit where biology meets culture, creating bonds that transcend individual survival.

Family is evolution's hack for creatures too complex to survive alone. Human babies are born helpless, requiring years of care. This dependency creates bonds stronger than logic - parents who die for children, siblings who share when hungry.

But family is more than blood. It's the first classroom where we learn love, conflict, hierarchy, sharing, and sacrifice. Adopted children, chosen families, found families - all prove that family is about commitment, not just chromosomes.

Every society builds on this foundation, scaling family principles into clans, tribes, and nations.
