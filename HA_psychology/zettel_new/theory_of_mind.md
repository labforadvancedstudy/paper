# Theory of Mind

The cognitive ability to understand that others have thoughts, beliefs, and intentions different from our own. The foundation of human social intelligence.

## Development Stages
- 18 months: Understanding desires
- 3 years: Understanding beliefs
- 4-5 years: Understanding false beliefs
- 6+ years: Second-order beliefs ("I think that you think that...")

## The False Belief Test
A child watches: Sally puts marble in basket, leaves room. Anne moves marble to box. Where will Sally look for marble?

Before age 4: "In the box" (where it actually is)
After age 4: "In the basket" (where Sally believes it is)

## When It Fails
- Autism spectrum (delayed/different development)
- Schizophrenia (over-attribution of intentions)
- Narcissism (reduced concern for others' minds)
