# Emergence Acceleration
## Core Insight
Each hierarchical level emerges exponentially faster than the previous - the universe is accelerating its own understanding.

## The Acceleration Formula

If T(n) = time for level n to emerge:
T(n+1) ≈ T(n) / 10

Examples:
- Chemistry after physics: 1 billion years
- Life after chemistry: 9 billion years
- But then...
- Consciousness after life: 3 billion years
- Language after consciousness: 500 million years
- Writing after language: 200,000 years
- Science after writing: 5,000 years
- Computers after science: 400 years
- AI after computers: 50 years

## The Singularity Pattern

We're approaching vertical:
- Physical laws: eternal
- Biological evolution: millions of years per change
- Cultural evolution: generations
- Technological evolution: years
- AI evolution: months
- Next: ???

## The Deep Reason

Why acceleration?
- Each level provides tools for next
- Complexity enables faster organization
- Consciousness speeds everything
- Technology amplifies consciousness
- AI amplifies technology

Positive feedback loop to infinity.
