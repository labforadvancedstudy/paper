# Spending

## Core Insight
Spending is the act of converting potential into actual - the moment when stored power transforms into lived experience, need satisfaction, or future regret.

Every spending decision is a micro-philosophy moment: What do I value? What's worth trading my crystallized time for? The pause before purchase isn't just calculation - it's existential evaluation. This shirt costs three hours of my life. This meal costs thirty minutes of effort. Is it worth it?

The emotional spectrum of spending:
- Necessity spending: grudging but required
- Impulse buying: dopamine now, regret later
- Planned purchase: satisfaction of delayed gratification
- Gift giving: spending as love language
- Panic buying: fear converting to action
- Revenge spending: emotion through transaction

Spending reveals who we are more than earning does. Our bank statements are our real autobiographies - showing values, fears, hopes, addictions, aspirations. Every transaction is a vote for the world we want to exist.
