# Legitimacy

## Core Insight
The mysterious quality that transforms power into authority, obedience into duty, and domination into governance - the social alchemy that makes political order feel proper rather than imposed.

Legitimacy is belief crystallized into acceptance. It's not about whether power is "really" legitimate (by what standard?), but whether people treat it as legitimate. This makes legitimacy both incredibly powerful and frighteningly fragile.

Sources of legitimacy shift like tides:
- Divine right (God chose the ruler)
- Tradition (it's always been this way)
- Conquest (might makes right)
- Contract (we agreed to this)
- Performance (it works)
- Procedure (followed the rules)
- Charisma (this person is special)

But legitimacy isn't binary. It exists in degrees, varies across populations, changes over time. A government might be legitimate to elites but not masses, to older generations but not younger, in the capital but not the provinces.

The crucial insight: legitimacy is performative. By acting as if power is legitimate (obeying laws, participating in rituals, using the language), we make it legitimate. Every citizen becomes a co-author of legitimacy through daily compliance.

Crisis comes when performance stops - when enough people simultaneously withdraw their recognition. Then the emperor's clothes dissolve, and power stands naked.
