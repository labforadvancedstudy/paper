# Constitution

## Core Insight
The rules about rules - the meta-law that structures how political power can be gained, exercised, and transferred, attempting to bind the future with words from the past.

A constitution is politics' ambitious attempt to limit itself. It's power writing the rules for power, like a person tying their own hands. The paradox: the power that makes constitutions can unmake them.

What constitutions do:
- Structure government (who does what)
- Limit power (what can't be done)
- Guarantee rights (what must be protected)
- Define procedures (how to decide)
- Express values (what we aspire to)
- Create identity (who we are)

The constitutional magic: dead people governing living ones. The founders, long buried, still shape daily life through their words. Every constitutional system is partly necrocracy - rule by the dead.

Constitutional types reveal different theories:
- Written vs unwritten (codified vs evolved)
- Rigid vs flexible (hard vs easy to change)
- Federal vs unitary (divided vs concentrated)
- Presidential vs parliamentary (separated vs fused)

But constitutions are never just their text. They're also:
- Interpretive traditions (what courts say)
- Political practices (how it's actually done)
- Public understanding (what people believe)
- Power struggles (who wins conflicts)

The core tension: constitutions must be stable enough to provide order but flexible enough to adapt. Too rigid and they break. Too flexible and they're meaningless.
