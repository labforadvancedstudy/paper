# Memory Time Travel

## Core Insight
Memory isn't storage - it's reconstruction. Every recall is a new creation.

You don't have a video library in your head. Each memory is rebuilt from fragments, influenced by current mood, recent events, and what you've learned since. That's why witnesses disagree, why childhood memories feel dreamlike, why you're sure you put the keys there (but didn't). Memory isn't about the past - it's about using the past to predict the future.
