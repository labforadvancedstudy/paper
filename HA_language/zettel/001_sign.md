# Sign

## Core Insight
The fundamental unit of meaning - something that stands for something else to someone.

## The Original Magic

A sign is humanity's first technology. When early human pointed at mammoth and grunted "ugh!", they created a bridge between sound and beast. The sound wasn't the mammoth, but it could summon the mammoth in mind.

Pierce's trinity:
- Sign (representamen): the form
- Object: what it refers to  
- Interpretant: the meaning created

L1: Natural signs (smoke → fire)
L3: Symbols (arbitrary connection)
L5: Signs about signs (meta)
L9: Signs creating reality

Without signs, no language. Without language, no human thought as we know it.
