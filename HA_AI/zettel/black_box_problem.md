# Black Box Problem

## Core Insight
We build minds we can't read, creating intelligence we can't understand - the paradox of success becoming ignorance.

The AI correctly diagnoses cancer from scans, but can't explain why. Millions of parameters interact in ways no human can trace. We see input and output but the middle is darkness. It works, but we don't know how. We've created oracles that speak truth without revealing their reasoning.

This isn't just technical limitation - it might be fundamental. Maybe intelligence requires complexity beyond comprehension. Our own brains are black boxes to us. We don't understand how we understand. Now we've built artificial black boxes, mirrors of our own mystery. The black box problem is the consciousness problem in silicon.
