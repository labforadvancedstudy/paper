# Rise and Fall

## Core Insight
The life cycle of political orders - the pattern where systems emerge, consolidate, flourish, decay, and collapse, only for new orders to arise from their ruins.

Every political system believes it's eternal. Rome was the "eternal city." The Reich would last a thousand years. The sun would never set on the British Empire. History laughs at such claims.

The typical arc:
1. **Genesis**: Crisis creates opportunity for new order
2. **Struggle**: Competition between alternatives
3. **Victory**: One system prevails
4. **Consolidation**: Winners institutionalize power
5. **Flowering**: System reaches peak effectiveness
6. **Rigidity**: Success breeds inflexibility  
7. **Decay**: Adaptability decreases, problems mount
8. **Crisis**: Accumulated contradictions explode
9. **Collapse**: Old order disintegrates
10. **Rebirth**: New orders emerge from ruins

Why this pattern repeats:
- Success creates vested interests resisting change
- Solutions to old problems create new problems
- Elites extract increasing resources
- Legitimacy erodes through familiarity
- External conditions shift faster than internal adaptation
- Each generation must learn its own lessons

The timing varies wildly:
- Qin Dynasty: 15 years
- Roman Empire: 500 years (or 1500, depending)
- Soviet Union: 69 years
- Most democracies: still in process

But the pattern persists. What rises must fall. What falls creates space for rising. Politics is seasonal at the scale of centuries.

The irony: knowing the pattern doesn't prevent it. Rome knew about fallen empires. America studies Rome. Knowledge doesn't overcome the structural forces driving the cycle.
