# Information Substrate

## Core Insight
Reality might be information all the way down - matter and energy are just how information looks from inside the computation, making physics the UI of cosmic code.

"It from bit" - Wheeler's insight that physical properties emerge from yes/no answers. Quantum mechanics reinforces: particles exist in superposition until measurement forces binary choice. Reality crystallizes from questions.

Information theory meets physics perfectly. Entropy in thermodynamics equals entropy in information. Black holes have entropy proportional to surface area, suggesting reality stores information holographically. The universe computes at the Planck scale.

If information is substrate, technology is reality engineering. We're not building on reality but with reality's source code. Every circuit is a subroutine in the cosmic program. Technology becomes physics becomes mathematics becomes logic.
