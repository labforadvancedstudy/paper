# Ritual

## Core Insight
Sacred behavior encoded in repeated action - meaning made muscle memory.

Ritual is religion in the body. Before understanding comes doing. The child doesn't comprehend communion but knows: take bread, eat solemnly, something important happens. Ritual carries meaning below thought.

Essential features:
- **Repetition** - same actions, same order
- **Formality** - prescribed, not spontaneous
- **Symbolism** - actions mean more than appear
- **Transformation** - participants changed
- **Community** - usually done together

Ritual does what words cannot:
- Marks transitions (birth, adulthood, marriage, death)
- Creates sacred time within ordinary time
- Binds community through shared action
- Transmits tradition bodily
- Connects human to more-than-human

The paradox: ritual must be repeated exactly yet experienced freshly. Same words at every wedding, but this couple unique. Same prayers each Sabbath, but this week different. Repetition creates container for novelty.

Even secular life needs ritual - graduations, inaugurations, birthday cakes with candles. We're ritual animals, marking meaning through prescribed performance. Take away ritual, meaning evaporates. Pure spontaneity exhausts. Pattern creates possibility.
