# Elasticity

## Core Insight
Economic sensitivity: how much things squirm when squeezed - the measure of market responsiveness.

Elasticity quantifies stubbornness versus flexibility. When price rises, how much does demand fall? When income grows, how much do purchases increase? It's economics' stress test.

Elasticity types:
- **Price elasticity** - demand response to price changes
- **Income elasticity** - demand response to income changes
- **Cross elasticity** - one good's response to another's price
- **Supply elasticity** - production response to price
- **Labor elasticity** - work response to wage changes

Elasticity reveals:
- Necessities are inelastic (need them regardless)
- Luxuries are elastic (easy to skip)
- Substitutes increase elasticity
- Time increases elasticity
- Habits decrease elasticity

The practical magic: elasticity determines who bears tax burden, whether price rises increase revenue, how shocks propagate through economies.

Addicts have zero elasticity - they'll pay anything. Competition creates infinite elasticity - tiny price difference loses all customers. Most goods live between these extremes.
