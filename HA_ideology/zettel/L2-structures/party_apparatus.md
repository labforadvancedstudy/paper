# Party Apparatus

## Core Insight
The machinery that turns belief into power - a hierarchical organism that ingests individual conviction and excretes collective action, coordinated and controlled.

The party isn't just people who share beliefs. It's an architecture of power:
- Base (mass membership, foot soldiers)
- Cadres (trained organizers, local leaders)
- Bureaucracy (administrators, functionaries)
- Leadership (decision makers, ideologists)
- Core (ultimate authority, often hidden)

Each level serves different functions:
- Base provides numbers, legitimacy, energy
- Cadres translate doctrine to action
- Bureaucracy maintains institutional memory
- Leadership sets direction, resolves conflicts
- Core embodies the party's soul

The apparatus includes:
- Communication channels (orders down, reports up)
- Discipline mechanisms (rewards, punishments)
- Recruitment systems (who gets in, who rises)
- Indoctrination methods (training, education)
- Resource flows (money, people, information)

Over time, the apparatus develops its own interests, separate from original ideology. Maintaining the party becomes more important than achieving its goals. The means consume the ends.

This is the iron law of oligarchy: every ideological movement that succeeds becomes what it fought against - a hierarchy serving itself.
