# Globalization

## Core Insight
The great flattening - where local becomes global instantly, creating homogeneous diversity that promises connection while risking the erasure of difference.

Globalization in art manifests:
- International art speak
- Biennial circuit sameness
- Instagram aesthetic convergence
- Art fair concentration
- Mega-gallery dominance

Benefits multiply:
- Cross-cultural dialogue
- Peripheral voices heard
- Digital access democratized
- Collaborative possibilities
- Market expansion

Costs accumulate:
- Local specificity lost
- Western hegemony reinforced
- Carbon footprint massive
- Economic inequality magnified
- Cultural extraction accelerated

Resistance strategies emerge:
- Indigenous resurgence
- Localist movements
- Language specificity
- Material locality
- Community rootedness

Art world globalizes unevenly:
- Centers still dominate (NY, London, HK)
- Periphery supplies difference
- Capital flows concentrated
- Mobility privileged
- Digital divides persist

Paradoxes abound:
- More diversity, more sameness
- Local sold as global exotic
- Connection enables isolation
- Access increases inequality
- Tradition becomes performance

Contemporary artists navigate:
- Code-switching necessary
- Multiple audiences addressed
- Translation constant
- Authenticity questioned
- Identity performed

Future tensions:
- Climate limits travel
- Digital enables/replaces
- Localities reassert
- New centers emerge
- Hybrid forms dominant
