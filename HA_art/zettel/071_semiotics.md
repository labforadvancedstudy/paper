# Semiotics

## Core Insight
The science of signs - where visual culture becomes readable as language, revealing how meaning circulates through chains of signifiers in endless referral.

Semiotic basics:
- Sign = signifier + signified
- Icon (resembles)
- Index (caused by)
- Symbol (arbitrary)
- Codes (cultural systems)

Art as sign system:
- Images signify beyond depiction
- Styles carry meanings
- Materials communicate
- Contexts transform
- Viewers decode

Key concepts applied:
- Denotation (literal)
- Connotation (associated)
- Myth (naturalized ideology)
- Paradigm (choices available)
- Syntagm (combinations made)

Barthes' contributions:
- Death of author
- Birth of reader
- Mythology exposed
- Pleasure/bliss distinction
- Punctum in photography

Visual semiotics reveals:
- Power in representation
- Ideology naturalized
- Codes culturally specific
- Meaning unstable
- Interpretation active

Contemporary applications:
- Emoji languages
- Meme grammars
- Brand semiotics
- Interface signs
- Algorithm interpretations

Criticisms noted:
- Over-intellectualization
- Cultural specificity ignored
- Linguistic imperialism
- Pleasure diminished
- Mystery destroyed

Yet tools valuable:
- Demystifies communication
- Reveals construction
- Empowers readers
- Questions natural
- Enables resistance

Art resists semiotics too: Excess, ambiguity, affect escape sign systems. Not everything signifies. Sometimes blue just blue.
