# Process Art

## Core Insight
The verb over the noun - where making becomes meaning, documentation equals artwork, and the journey matters more than any destination.

Process art reveals:
- Time's passage
- Material behavior
- Chance operations
- Physical forces
- Human limits

Key practitioners:
- Serra (throwing lead)
- Morris (felt gravity)
- Benglis (poured latex)
- Smithson (entropy demonstrations)
- Nauman (studio activities)

Materials teach:
- Gravity shapes
- Time degrades
- Heat transforms
- Pressure marks
- Nature collaborates

Documentation strategies:
- Photography series
- Film/video
- Written instructions
- Material traces
- Oral histories

Process types:
- Additive (accumulation)
- Subtractive (erosion)
- Transformative (state change)
- Durational (time-based)
- Collaborative (multiple agents)

Contemporary process:
- Live-streaming creation
- Time-lapse documentation
- Algorithmic processes
- Crowd-sourced making
- AI collaboration

Philosophical implications:
- Product questioned
- Labor visible
- Control released
- Accident embraced
- Ego diminished

Market challenges:
- What to sell?
- How to collect?
- Documentation value?
- Re-performance rights?
- Conservation impossible?

Process becomes metaphor: Life is process. Art mirrors. Nothing fixed. Everything becoming. The making makes us.
