# Purpose

## Core Insight
The "why" that consciousness adds to causation - meaning's arrow.

## Teleology's Ghost

Aristotle saw purpose everywhere: acorns "want" to become oaks. Science killed teleology - things just happen, no purpose. But consciousness creates purpose. Your purpose reading this. My purpose writing it.

L1: Want food, avoid pain
L2: Serve the gods
L3: Achieve excellence
L4: Follow duty
L5: Create meaning
L6: Purpose is projection
L7: Purpose masks power
L8: Optimization targets
L9: Strange attractors

The existential joke: universe has no purpose, but we can't live without one.
