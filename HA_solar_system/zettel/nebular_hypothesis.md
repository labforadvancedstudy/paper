# Nebular Hypothesis

## Core Insight
The Solar System began as a cloud of dust and gas that collapsed under its own weight - gravity transforming diffuse nothing into the organized everything we call home.

Four and a half billion years ago, a molecular cloud drifted in space. Perhaps a nearby supernova's shockwave nudged it, or it simply reached critical density. Gravity took hold. The cloud collapsed, spinning faster as it shrank, flattening into a disk. The center grew hot enough to ignite fusion - the Sun was born. In the surrounding disk, dust grains collided, stuck, grew into pebbles, rocks, planetesimals, planets.

This simple story explains so much: why planets orbit in the same direction, why they lie in nearly the same plane, why rocky planets formed close and gas giants far. The nebular hypothesis shows how natural processes can create organized systems from chaos. No design needed, just gravity, angular momentum, and time. We are stardust, literally - organized by the universe's most democratic force.
