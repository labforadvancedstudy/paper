# Bubbles and Crashes

## Core Insight
Bubbles and crashes are what happens when collective psychology meets mathematical reality - human emotions amplified by feedback loops until arithmetic reasserts itself.

Every bubble follows the same script. First, a genuine innovation or opportunity (railroads, internet, housing). Early investors make real profits. Success attracts attention. More buy in. Prices rise. Rising prices "prove" the thesis. More pile in. 

Then comes the mania phase. "This time is different." Traditional valuation is "outdated." Everyone knows someone getting rich. FOMO (fear of missing out) overrides logic. Taxi drivers give stock tips. Shoeshine boys buy crypto.

The fascinating part: everyone knows bubbles exist, yet bubbles keep happening. Why? Because it's rational to participate in an irrational bubble if you think you can exit before others. This creates a game of musical chairs where everyone thinks they'll get a seat.

The crash is psychology in reverse. Someone sells. Prices dip. Others worry and sell. Prices fall faster. Panic spreads. Everyone rushes for the exit. What took years to build collapses in days. The same feedback loops that inflated now deflate.

But here's the twist: bubbles often leave behind useful infrastructure. The dot-com bubble built the fiber optic cables we use today. Railway bubbles created transportation networks. Even tulip mania advanced futures markets. Bubbles are how capitalism does moon shots - wastefully but effectively.
