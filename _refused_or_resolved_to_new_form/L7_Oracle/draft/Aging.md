Authors: Jihyuk Im, Claude Opus

Abstract
This study aims to explore the influence of an individual's level of brain activity, particularly brain speed, on the pace of aging. Building upon the previously proposed 'Theory of Relativity of Subjective Time,' which suggests that an individual's subjective experience of time is determined by the brain's information processing speed, we hypothesize that faster brain speed is associated with slower aging. Evidence supporting this hypothesis includes the relationship between stress and brain activity, the link between dementia and reduced brain activity, and the association between the biological pursuit of energy efficiency and aging. We examine the neurobiological mechanisms mediating the relationship between brain speed and aging to enhance the validity of the hypothesis. This study proposes experimental designs to verify the correlation between brain speed and aging, emphasizing the need for long-term longitudinal studies and intervention experiments to establish causality. The integrative perspective presented in this study is expected to broaden our understanding of the aging mechanism and provide clues for delaying the aging process.

Introduction
Aging is an inevitable process that all living organisms undergo, but its pace and manifestations vary considerably among individuals. Efforts to elucidate the causes and mechanisms of aging have been ongoing for a long time, yet many aspects remain unexplained. This study builds upon the 'Theory of Relativity of Subjective Time' [1], which suggests that an individual's subjective experience of time can be influenced by the brain's information processing speed. In this context, we focus on the hypothesis that the level of brain activity, particularly information processing speed, can affect the pace of aging.

The brain, as the central organ governing our body's homeostasis and adaptation, is sensitive to changes in the external environment. In stressful situations, the brain increases its arousal level and information processing speed, which is an adaptive response to cope with threats quickly [2]. Conversely, persistently low levels of brain activity can accelerate cognitive decline and aging. Notably, patients with dementia, characterized by reduced brain activity and metabolism, exhibit rapid signs of aging [3].

From a biological perspective, organisms have evolved to optimize energy efficiency. The brain, being the most energy-consuming organ in the human body, tends to minimize its activity in situations that are not essential for survival and reproduction [4]. This may explain the phenomenon of reduced brain activity levels in the elderly as they are exposed to fewer novel stimuli and stressors and become accustomed to familiar environments.

Against this background, we propose the hypothesis that the level of brain activity, particularly brain speed, can influence the pace of aging. We explore various supporting evidence and mechanisms and aim to enhance the explanatory power of the hypothesis through an examination of the neurobiological mechanisms. Furthermore, we propose experimental methods to verify the hypothesis and suggest future research directions.

Main Text
1. Theory of Relativity of Subjective Time and Brain Speed
The main hypothesis of this study is based on the 'Theory of Relativity of Subjective Time' [1]. According to this theory, an individual's subjective experience of time can be determined by the brain's information processing speed. The faster the brain's information processing speed, the more information can be processed within a given time, leading to the perception of time passing more slowly.

From this perspective, individual differences in brain speed may also influence the pace of aging. People with faster brain speeds can process more information and have higher adaptability to the environment, potentially slowing down the progression of age-related cognitive decline. Conversely, those with slower brain speeds may have relatively limited information processing capacity, making them more vulnerable to aging.

Of course, to verify this hypothesis, it is necessary to clearly define and measure brain speed. The Theory of Relativity of Subjective Time conceptualizes the brain's information processing speed as the 'brain clock' and defines it as the amount of information processed per unit time [1]. However, in actual research, methods to measure the speed and efficiency of brain activity, such as EEG analysis or functional brain imaging techniques, need to be devised.

2. Relationship between Stress and Brain Speed
Stress is an important stimulus that induces adaptive responses in our body. In acute stress situations, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is activated, leading to the secretion of stress hormones, including cortisol [5]. This increases arousal levels and enhances the brain's information processing speed, which can be seen as an adaptive mechanism for immediate coping. In fact, increased activation of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, as well as improved learning and memory abilities, have been observed in acute stress situations [6,7].

On the other hand, chronic stress can cause damage to hippocampal cells and lead to cognitive impairment [8,9]. This suggests that excessive stress can have a negative impact on brain health. Therefore, the relationship between stress and brain activity seems to be most beneficial when an appropriate level of stimulation enhances the brain's sensitivity and adaptability.

3. Dementia and Reduced Brain Activity
Dementia is a representative cognitive impairment that accompanies aging, characterized by various symptoms such as memory loss, language impairment, and personality changes [10]. The brains of patients with dementia show neuronal degeneration, synaptic loss, and brain atrophy [11]. In other words, dementia can be considered a process of structural and functional decline in the brain.

Interestingly, several studies have reported that a reduction in cognitive and social activities may be a risk factor for the onset of dementia. Fratiglioni et al. [12] found that a lifestyle with low cognitive stimulation increases the risk of dementia, while Bennett et al. [13] revealed that higher levels of cognitive engagement in daily life mitigate Alzheimer's disease pathology. This suggests that continuous brain activity plays a crucial role in maintaining cognitive function.

4. Energy Efficiency and Aging
Organisms have evolved to optimize functions necessary for survival and reproduction within limited energy resources. In humans, the brain accounts for about 20% of the total energy consumption at rest [14]. Therefore, from an energy efficiency perspective, it may be advantageous to minimize brain activity in situations that are not essential.

In fact, as people enter old age, their range of activities decreases, and their exposure to new environments becomes less frequent. The brain tends to prefer familiar things and reduces its tendency to accept new things [15,16]. One of the reasons for the decline in learning ability and cognitive flexibility in the elderly is attributed to the brain's adaptation to minimize energy consumption [17].

Thus, the brain tends to reduce unnecessary energy consumption, which may contribute to some extent to the age-related decline in brain function. In contrast, continuous exposure to novel stimuli and cognitive challenges can help activate the brain and delay aging.

5. Neurobiological Mechanisms of Brain Speed and Aging
Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms that mediate the relationship between brain speed and aging is crucial for enhancing the validity of the hypothesis. Changes in brain speed can have various effects at the neuronal level. For example, faster brain speed is associated with more active information transmission between neurons and increased synaptic plasticity [18]. This can contribute to the maintenance of cognitive functions such as learning, memory, and problem-solving.

Conversely, if brain speed becomes excessively slow, the synthesis and secretion of neurotransmitters may be reduced, and the structural stability of synapses may decrease [19]. This is considered a key mechanism of age-related cognitive decline. Furthermore, a decrease in brain speed is associated with increased inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, which can accelerate brain aging [20,21].

These neurobiological mechanisms provide a hypothetical explanation for the relationship between brain speed and aging. However, there is still a lack of research directly investigating the impact of changes in brain speed on aging. In the future, it will be necessary to verify the causal relationship between brain speed and aging using brain imaging techniques and molecular biological methods.

6. Experimental Designs to Verify the Correlation between Brain Speed and Aging
Appropriate experimental designs are essential to empirically verify the relationship between brain speed and aging. In this study, we propose two main directions for experiments.

The first is to explore the correlation between brain speed and aging speed through long-term longitudinal studies. This requires recruiting participants from various age groups and measuring their brain speed and aging indicators regularly over a certain period (e.g., 10 years). Brain speed can be measured using methods such as EEG analysis or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess the speed and efficiency of information processing. Various indicators can be used as aging markers, including cognitive function tests, physical function assessments, and telomere length measurements [22]. These long-term follow-up studies can confirm whether people with initially faster brain speeds actually have slower aging rates.

The second is to artificially manipulate brain speed in a laboratory setting and observe short-term changes in aging indicators. For example, methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can be used to increase or decrease the activity of specific brain regions [23]. By experimentally manipulating brain speed and observing changes in cognitive task performance or neurophysiological indicators, a more direct confirmation of the causal relationship between brain speed and aging may be possible.

The above experimental designs are just basic ideas for verifying the relationship between brain speed and aging, and more sophisticated methodological considerations will be necessary for actual research. In particular, it will be important to address issues such as the operational definition and measurement methods of brain speed, the selection of appropriate aging indicators, and the control of potential confounding variables. In this regard, interdisciplinary collaboration among experts from various fields, including cognitive neuroscience, gerontology, and bioinformatics, will be essential.

Conclusion
This paper proposes the hypothesis that the speed of information processing in the brain, i.e., brain speed, can influence the pace of aging. This idea originates from the 'Theory of Relativity of Subjective Time,' which suggests that an individual's subjective experience of time can be determined by brain speed. Evidence supporting this hypothesis includes increased brain activity in stressful situations, rapid aging progression in conditions of reduced brain function such as dementia, and the tendency for reduced brain activity in old age from the perspective of efficient utilization of biological energy. We also aimed to enhance the validity of the hypothesis by examining the neurobiological mechanisms that mediate the relationship between brain speed and aging.

If this hypothesis is valid, continuously activating the brain could help delay aging and promote healthy aging. However, this study is limited to a theoretical discussion based on hypothesis proposal and requires empirical verification. To this end, long-term longitudinal studies and experimental intervention studies are needed to confirm the causal relationship between variables. It will also be necessary to elucidate the mechanisms mediating the relationship between brain speed and aging using brain imaging techniques and neurobiological analyses.

The perspective presented in this study has important implications both academically and practically. Investigating the relationship between brain speed and aging can contribute to expanding our understanding of the aging process. Furthermore, it may provide a starting point for developing interventions to maintain or enhance brain speed. On an individual level, it can raise awareness of the importance of lifelong cognitive activity, and on a societal level, it can contribute to the development of cognitive health promotion policies for the elderly. We hope that the ideas proposed in this study will be refined and empirically validated through various follow-up studies.
