# Homeostasis

## Core Insight
Life is a tightrope walker that never stops walking - constantly adjusting to stay balanced in a universe trying to knock it down.

Your body is obsessed with specific numbers. Temperature: 37°C. Blood pH: 7.4. Glucose: 90 mg/dL. Deviate too far and you die. So thousands of feedback loops work every second to maintain these values.

But here's the paradox: you maintain constancy through constant change. Your temperature stays fixed by constantly adjusting heat production and loss. Your pH stays stable by constantly shuffling ions. You stay the same by never staying the same.

It's dynamic equilibrium - like riding a bicycle. Stop pedaling and you fall. Stop adjusting and you die. Stability isn't a state, it's an active process. Life doesn't find balance; it creates it moment by moment.

The miracle: no manager coordinates this. Each system responds to local signals, yet global stability emerges. It's democracy at the cellular level, and it works better than any designed system.
