# Noun

## Core Insight  
The anchor of thought - names for everything we can think about.

## The Naming Instinct

First human words were probably nouns. Point at mammoth, grunt "ugh!" - noun is born. Nouns let us think about things not present, discuss abstract concepts, build civilization.

Noun universals:
- **Number**: Singular/plural (some add dual, trial)
- **Gender**: Masculine/feminine/neuter (arbitrary!)
- **Case**: Role in sentence (nominative, accusative, etc.)
- **Definiteness**: The/a distinction
- **Animacy**: Living vs non-living

Noun hierarchies:
L1: Concrete objects (rock, tree, mammoth)
L2: People and animals (mother, dog)
L3: Abstract concepts (love, justice)
L4: Actions as things (the running)
L5: Meta-nouns (word, noun, concept)

Fun fact: Some languages have 20+ noun classes. Swahili has classes for humans, trees, abstracts, liquids...
