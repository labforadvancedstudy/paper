# Day Night Cycle

## Core Insight
The rhythm of light and dark is so fundamental we built our biology around it - the Solar System's most intimate gift to life.

Day. Night. Day. Night. This binary beat structures all existence on Earth. We wake with light, sleep with darkness, so deeply that jet lag feels like betrayal by the cosmos. The cycle is experience before understanding - no one needs to explain why night follows day, it simply does, reliable as breathing.

But within simplicity lies complexity. Days vary in length, nights stretch or shrink with seasons. The cycle isn't mechanical but alive, breathing with the year. Sunrise and sunset paint the sky in colors that exist nowhere else, transition zones where day and night merge in painted glory. We organize entire civilizations around this rhythm: work-sleep, public-private, conscious-unconscious.
