# Periodic Patterns

## Core Insight
Elements repeat their properties in cycles - nature's own filing system, organizing matter by electron configuration.

Mendeleev saw patterns where others saw chaos. Line up elements by mass, properties repeat: reactive metal, less reactive, less reactive, unreactive gas, then boom - reactive metal again. The pattern was so clear he predicted missing elements.

Why? Electron shells fill in patterns. First shell: 2 electrons. Second: 8. Third: 8 (sort of). When a shell fills, the element is stable, unreactive. One electron in a new shell? Highly reactive. One electron short of full? Desperate to grab one.

The periodic table isn't just a list - it's a map of electron desires. Each column shares electron arrangements, therefore chemistry. Each row adds a shell. Position predicts properties. Chemistry becomes predictable.
