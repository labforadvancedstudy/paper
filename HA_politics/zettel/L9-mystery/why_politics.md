# Why Politics

## Core Insight
The deepest mystery: why does politics exist at all? Why don't we live in anarchic harmony or perfect dictatorship? Why this strange middle ground of conflict and cooperation, rule and resistance?

Perhaps politics is inevitable wherever multiple consciousnesses share space and resources. The moment there are two humans and one apple, politics begins. But why this PARTICULAR form - with all its elaborate rituals, institutions, ideologies?

Consider the alternatives that didn't evolve:
- Pure force hierarchy (like some animals)
- Hardwired cooperation (like social insects)  
- Complete isolation (no society at all)
- Psychic unity (shared consciousness)

Instead, we got politics: formalized conflict, ritualized power transfer, institutionalized disagreement. As if the universe wanted to explore every possible way conscious beings might organize themselves.

Maybe politics is:
- Consciousness trying to coordinate with itself
- The universe exploring governance possibilities
- Evolution's experiment in collective decision-making
- The price of having separate minds
- What happens when cooperation and competition mix

Or perhaps asking "why politics" is like asking "why gravity" - it simply IS, a fundamental feature of conscious beings sharing reality.

The mystery deepens: every attempt to end politics (utopian communities, totalitarian states) generates more politics. As if politics were not a problem to solve but a condition to accept - like mortality, but for groups.

We are political animals not by choice but by nature. Politics is the water we swim in, invisible until we try to leave it. And perhaps that's the answer: politics exists because we exist as separate beings who must somehow live together.

The question that remains: is politics a phase consciousness passes through, or its permanent condition?
