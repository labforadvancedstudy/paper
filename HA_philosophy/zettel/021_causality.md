# Causality

## Core Insight
The because that connects events - reality's plot device.

## Hume's Hammer

We see ball A hit ball B. B moves. We say A caused B to move. But Hume asks: did you see the causation? No. You saw sequence. Causation is habit of mind, not property of world.

L1: This makes that happen
L2: Gods cause events  
L3: Four types of causes
L4: Necessary connection
L5: Regular succession
L6: Correlation patterns
L7: Narrative construction
L8: Conditional probability
L9: Causation emerges from correlations

Modern twist: quantum mechanics has events without causes. Particles decay randomly. Causation is statistical, not absolute.
