# Group Selection

Controversial: Can selection act on groups?

Yes, when:
- Groups compete
- Low migration between groups
- High cooperation within groups
- Groups can "reproduce" (split)

Human tribes: Cooperative groups conquered selfish ones.
Social insects: Colony as superorganism.
Cancer: Selfish cells kill host (and themselves).

Multilevel selection: Genes, individuals, groups all selected.
