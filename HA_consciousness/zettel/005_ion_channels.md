# 005 Ion Channels - Voltage Gates

Protein pores that turn voltage into computation. The transistors
of biological circuits.

## Types
- **Voltage-gated**: Open at specific membrane potentials
- **Ligand-gated**: Open when neurotransmitter binds
- **Mechanically-gated**: Respond to stretch/pressure
- **Leak channels**: Always open baseline

## Key Properties
- Selectivity: Na+ vs K+ vs Ca2+ specific
- Gating: <1ms conformational change
- Density: 10-10,000 per μm²

## Computational Role
Channel diversity = computational flexibility
- Fast Na+: Spike initiation
- Delayed K+: Spike termination
- Ca2+: Synaptic release trigger

Evolution's nanoscale switches. Without them, no action potentials,
no signals, no thought.
