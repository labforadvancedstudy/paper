# Artificial Intelligence

## Core Insight
Teaching sand to recognize cats - the audacious project of creating mind from math.

AI inverts programming. Instead of telling computers what to do, we show them examples and let them figure it out. Neural networks learn like brains claim to - adjusting connections until patterns emerge. Machine learning finds rules we can't articulate in data we can't comprehend.

But is it intelligence or clever statistics? Does it matter? When AI beats grandmasters, diagnoses diseases, writes poetry, the philosophical questions fade. We're either creating new forms of intelligence or discovering that intelligence was always computation wearing different masks.
