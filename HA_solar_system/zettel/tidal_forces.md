# Tidal Forces

## Core Insight
Gravity's grip varies with distance, creating stretching forces that sculpt worlds, lock rotations, and turn moons into planetary rings - the differential pull that shapes the Solar System.

The Moon pulls Earth's near side harder than its far side. This difference - tidal force - raises ocean bulges that chase the Moon around Earth. But tides go beyond water. Rock tides flex solid Earth. Atmospheric tides pulse the air. The same force that creates beach schedules also slowed Earth's rotation and locked the Moon to show us one face forever.

Tidal forces are gravity's sculptors. They ripped apart moons that ventured too close to planets, creating Saturn's rings. They heat Io's interior through flexing, driving volcanic eruptions. They're gradually pushing the Moon away from Earth, lengthening our days. In the differential pull between near and far, the Solar System finds another mechanism for change and evolution.
