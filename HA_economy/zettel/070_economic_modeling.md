# Economic Modeling

## Core Insight
Economic models are maps of reality - useful precisely because they leave out most details, dangerous when we forget they're not the territory itself.

Joan Robinson said it best: "A model which took account of all the variegation of reality would be of no more use than a map at the scale of one to one." Models gain power through simplification. Assume perfect competition, rational actors, complete information - not because they're true, but because they let us see specific mechanisms clearly.

But there's an art to knowing what to leave out. Too simple and you miss crucial dynamics (2008 crisis models ignored financial interconnections). Too complex and you can't understand what drives what (modern DSGE models with hundreds of equations).

Models also shape reality. Black-Scholes option pricing didn't just describe markets - it changed them. Traders started using the formula, making markets behave more like the model predicted. The map modified the territory.

There's also the seduction of mathematics. A model with elegant equations feels true. But mathematical beauty doesn't equal empirical accuracy. String theory for economics - beautiful math, unclear connection to reality.

The deepest issue: models embed worldviews. Equilibrium models suggest stability. Agent-based models suggest emergence. Network models suggest contagion. The model you choose shapes what questions you ask and what answers you'll accept.

Models are both economics' greatest strength and weakness - they let us think clearly about complex systems, but clarity isn't truth.
