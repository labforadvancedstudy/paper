# Cultural Meme Evolution

Genes: Biological evolution, slow.
Memes: Cultural evolution, fast.

Memes compete for:
- Attention (limited resource)
- Transmission (copying fidelity)
- Longevity (cultural memory)

Successful memes shape civilization faster than genes shape biology.
Religions, ideologies, fashions = memetic organisms.
