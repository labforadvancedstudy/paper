# Orbit

## Core Insight
Falling forever around something - the perfect balance between wanting to fly away and being pulled back, creating an eternal dance in space.

An orbit is what happens when you throw something so fast sideways that it misses the ground forever. You're always falling toward the planet/star/moon, but moving sideways fast enough that you keep missing. It's the universe's way of storing kinetic energy as position.

Orbital mechanics is beautifully deterministic:
- Given position and velocity, the future is fixed
- Energy determines orbit size
- Angular momentum determines orbit shape
- Every orbit is a conic section (circle, ellipse, parabola, hyperbola)

Key orbital truths that defy Earth intuition:
- Higher orbits move slower (less velocity, longer periods)
- To catch up, slow down (lower orbit = faster motion)
- To go higher, speed up twice (once to ellipse, once to circularize)
- Orbits don't decay in vacuum (but space isn't perfectly empty)

Useful orbital positions:
- LEO (Low Earth Orbit): Fast, close, but draggy
- GEO (Geostationary): Stays above one spot
- L-points: Gravitational balance points
- Polar: Sees entire planet surface
- Sun-synchronous: Constant lighting conditions

Orbits are free storage. Once achieved, maintaining them costs nothing (in theory). They're nature's parking spaces, holding patterns written in gravity and velocity.
