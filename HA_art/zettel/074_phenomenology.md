# Phenomenology

## Core Insight
Return to things themselves - where consciousness meets world directly, bracketing assumptions to reveal how art appears to embodied perception before interpretation.

Phenomenological method:
- Bracket assumptions
- Describe appearance
- Attend to givenness
- Note intentionality
- Reveal essence

Merleau-Ponty's insights:
- Perception embodied
- Body thinks
- Flesh of world
- Reversibility central
- Chiasm structure

Art phenomenology reveals:
- Pre-cognitive experience
- Bodily response
- Temporal unfolding
- Spatial involvement
- Material presence

Key concepts:
- Lived experience
- Being-in-world
- Intercorporeality
- Motor intentionality
- Perceptual faith

Phenomenological artists:
- Giacometti (appearance)
- Cézanne (sensation)
- Serra (weight/space)
- Turrell (light perception)
- Eliasson (phenomena)

Methods in practice:
- Slow looking
- Body awareness
- Environmental attention
- Temporal patience
- Judgment suspension

Digital challenges:
- Screen mediation
- Disembodied viewing
- Speed culture
- Attention fragmentation
- Virtual presence

Contemporary relevance:
- Mindfulness parallels
- Somatic practices
- Slow art movement
- Presence emphasis
- Experience economy

Phenomenology reminds: Before meaning, appearance. Before interpretation, encounter. Art happens in lived moment between viewer and work. Theory comes after.
