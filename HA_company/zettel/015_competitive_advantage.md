# Competitive Advantage

## Core Insight
Competitive advantage is sustainable difference - the rare combination of being better, different, or both in ways competitors cannot easily copy.

Advantage comes in flavors: cost (do it cheaper), differentiation (do it better), focus (do it for specific segment). But true advantage runs deeper than tactics. It's about creating positions others can't occupy without destroying their own business.

The best advantages compound. Brand reinforces premium pricing. Scale enables R&D. Network effects create lock-in. Learning curves steepen. Each advantage strengthens others, creating widening moats around the business castle.

But no advantage lasts forever. Competition copies, technology changes, customers evolve. Yesterday's advantage becomes today's table stakes. The only sustainable advantage might be the ability to create new advantages faster than competitors destroy old ones.
