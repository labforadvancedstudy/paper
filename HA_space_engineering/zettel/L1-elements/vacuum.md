# Vacuum

## Core Insight
The ultimate absence - no air to breathe, carry sound, or conduct heat, creating an environment that breaks every Earth-evolved intuition about how things work.

Space vacuum is emptier than anything we can create on Earth. Not just "thin air" but actual nothingness - fewer molecules per cubic meter than the best laboratory vacuums. This absence shapes everything about space engineering.

What vacuum means for engineering:
- No convection (heat only radiates)
- No oxidation (materials behave differently)
- No pressure (liquids boil, gases expand)
- No sound (explosions are silent)
- No aerodynamics (shape doesn't matter for movement)
- Extreme temperature swings (no air to moderate)

Vacuum's cruel truths:
- Humans die in ~15 seconds without pressure suits
- Lubricants evaporate (cold welding of metals)
- Outgassing corrupts sensitive instruments
- Heat rejection becomes a major problem
- Micrometeorites hit with no atmospheric braking

But vacuum also enables:
- Perfect telescope seeing (no atmospheric distortion)
- Unlimited solar power (no clouds or night)
- Efficient ion propulsion (no air resistance)
- Long-term preservation (no corrosion)

Vacuum isn't just empty space - it's an engineering environment that demands completely different solutions than Earth. Every seal, every material, every system must be designed for the ultimate absence.
