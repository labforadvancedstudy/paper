# Memory Consolidation

Making memories stick.

Process:
- Encoding: Experience → Neural pattern
- Consolidation: Pattern → Stable structure
- Storage: Distributed across brain

Sleep critical:
- REM: Emotional memories
- Slow wave: Factual memories
- Dreams: Replay and reorganize

Reconsolidation:
Recalling makes changeable.
Memories are reconstructions.
