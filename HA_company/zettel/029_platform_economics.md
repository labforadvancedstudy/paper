# Platform Economics

## Core Insight
Platforms invert traditional economics - instead of creating value directly, they enable others to create value, capturing a portion while scaling infinitely.

Traditional pipeline: Company → Product → Customer. Platform model: Producers ↔ Platform ↔ Consumers. The platform doesn't create products but connections. Value emerges from interactions, not transactions. Scale comes from facilitating, not manufacturing.

Platform economics are magical. Zero marginal cost for additional transactions. Network effects compound value. Winner-take-all dynamics emerge. The platform that achieves critical mass becomes almost impossible to displace. Economic gravity wells form.

But platforms face unique challenges. Chicken-and-egg launch problems. Quality control without direct control. Balancing ecosystem interests. Regulatory scrutiny as quasi-utilities. The platform must serve multiple masters while capturing sufficient value to survive.
