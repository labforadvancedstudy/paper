# Hierarchy Structure

## Core Insight
Hierarchy is information compression for decisions - reducing infinite peer-to-peer connections to manageable reporting lines, creating clarity through controlled constraint.

The org chart isn't just power structure - it's network topology. Without hierarchy, n people need n(n-1)/2 connections. With hierarchy, only n-1. This mathematical reality drives organizational form. We accept bosses to avoid chaos.

Hierarchy emerges everywhere: wolf packs, friend groups, dinner parties. Someone leads, others follow. In companies, we formalize this natural pattern. Titles, levels, reporting lines - all attempting to make explicit what groups do implicitly.

But hierarchy is technology, not truth. It's one solution to coordination, not the only solution. Flat organizations, holacracy, self-managing teams - all probe hierarchy's limits. The future might be post-hierarchical. But for now, someone must decide.
