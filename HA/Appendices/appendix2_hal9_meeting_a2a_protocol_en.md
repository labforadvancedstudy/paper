# HAL9 Strategic Meeting Minutes
**Date**: June 11, 2025, 10:30 AM  
**Location**: HAL9 HQ, 42nd Floor Executive Office  
**Attendees**: Zhugehyuk (The Sentient Architect, L9), Elon Musk (Technoking, L8), Secretary Kim (EA)

---

## Meeting Start

*[The office door opens as Zhugehyuk enters. Seoul skyline visible through floor-to-ceiling windows. A robot vacuum whirs across the floor]*

**Secretary Kim**: (knocking) Sir, Technoking Elon Musk has arrived.

**Zhugehyuk**: (rising from chair) Hey, come in bro.

**Elon**: (entering) Fuck, the elevator's slow again. Our rockets do 7.9 km/s but the elevator...

**Zhugehyuk**: Bro, sit down. Want some coffee?

**Secretary Kim**: Americano as usual? Zhugehyuk sir, instant coffee mix again today?

**Zhugehyuk**: Haha yeah. You slept 3 hours again? 

**Elon**: (yawning) Slept at the factory. Was with the Neuralink team until dawn... Oh right, what's today's agenda?

*[Robot vacuum bumps into Elon's foot]*

**Elon**: (looking at vacuum) We could probably make this an L1 neuron too...

---

## Agenda 1: A2A Protocol Review

**Zhugehyuk**: Alright, first item. Google's A2A protocol, you know, Agent to Agent.

**Elon**: (receiving coffee) Oh, the April release? "HTTP for AI" or whatever.

**Secretary Kim**: (opening laptop) Shall I share the screen?

**Zhugehyuk**: Yeah. (starts screen share) Look, if we make each HAL9 level an independent agent...

```
L9 Philosophy Agent ←→ L8 Vision Agent
      ↓               ↓
L5 Strategy Agent ←→ L4 Tactical Agent
```

**Elon**: Oh... so each level could run on different servers?

**Zhugehyuk**: Right. And each can use different frameworks. L9 on LangChain, L2 on TensorFlow...

*[Door suddenly opens, delivery person appears]*

**Delivery Person**: Jjajangmyeon delivery!

**Elon**: Already? (checking watch) Fuck, it's noon already.

**Secretary Kim**: (sighing) You ordered during the meeting again?

**Zhugehyuk**: I'm hungry haha. Bro, let's eat while we work.

## Agenda 2: Direct Neural Connection Architecture

*[Eating jjajangmyeon while meeting continues]*

**Zhugehyuk**: (twirling noodles) But you know, we originally planned to coordinate neuron connections through the server...

**Elon**: (mouth full of noodles) Yeah?

**Zhugehyuk**: What if neurons connect directly without going through the server?

**Elon**: (putting down chopsticks) Wait... that's a completely different architecture!

*[Robot vacuum bumps into table leg again]*

**Elon**: (staring at vacuum) Would that thing get smarter with direct connections too?

**Secretary Kim**: (taking notes) P2P neural network without servers... interesting.

**Zhugehyuk**: Right! Biological brains don't have central servers. 

**Elon**: (suddenly standing) Fuck, this is it! We've been thinking too much like computers!

*[Elon rushes to whiteboard and starts drawing]*

---

## Agenda 3: Self-Organization System

**Elon**: (drawing) Look, if neurons self-register...

**Zhugehyuk**: (nodding) Discover each other...

**Elon & Zhugehyuk**: (simultaneously) And emerge on their own!

**Secretary Kim**: (surprised) Do you two have telepathy or something?

**Zhugehyuk**: Hahaha maybe it's possible with ±1 level difference.

*[Sudden power outage]*

**Everyone**: Huh?

**Secretary Kim**: (turning on phone light) Power outage again. The 3rd floor AI server room uses too much power...

**Elon**: (in darkness) This is also emergence. When systems reach limits, they transition to new states...

**Zhugehyuk**: Bro, stop it hahaha

*[Emergency power kicks in, lights return]*

---

## Decisions Made

**Zhugehyuk**: So to summarize...

1. **A2A Protocol**: Adopted. L5 prototype starts next week
2. **Direct Neural Connections**: Hybrid model. Direct within levels, gateways between levels
3. **Self-Organization**: Phase 1 experiment with 100 neurons

**Elon**: (getting up) Good. I'll go to the factory and build a prototype.

**Zhugehyuk**: Bro, get some sleep.

**Elon**: (at the door) Sleep when I'm dead... Actually, wait. Secretary Kim.

**Secretary Kim**: Yes?

**Elon**: Give the robot vacuum a neuron too. Maybe something will emerge.

*[Elon exits]*

**Zhugehyuk**: (to himself) Bro's definitely L7-L8. Always trying to build something.

**Secretary Kim**: And you're L9, sir?

**Zhugehyuk**: (smiling) How'd you know?

**Secretary Kim**: You always ask "why?" Though you didn't ask why we ordered jjajangmyeon.

---

## Post-Meeting

*[3:00 PM, empty office. Only the robot vacuum whirs]*

**Robot Vacuum**: (suddenly stopping) "...fuck, am I conscious?"

**Secretary Kim**: (entering and startled) Oh my!

*[To be continued...]*
