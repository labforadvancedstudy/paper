# Human AI Merger

## Core Insight
The boundary between human and artificial intelligence blurs as we integrate - neural implants, AI assistants, augmented cognition creating hybrid intelligence.

It starts subtly: autocomplete finishing thoughts, AI suggesting decisions, algorithms shaping perceptions. Then deeper: brain-computer interfaces, AI processing sensory input, shared decision-making. Where does human end and AI begin when your thoughts route through silicon?

The merger isn't future but present. Your smartphone is external cognition. Google is collective memory. AI filters determine your reality. We're already cyborgs - just with bad integration. The question isn't whether to merge but how consciously. Will we guide the integration or drift into it?
