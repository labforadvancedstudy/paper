# Philosophy Practice

## Core Insight
Thinking through making - where philosophy doesn't just describe art but emerges from artistic practice, creating knowledge through material engagement rather than abstract reasoning.

Practice as research:
- Making generates theory
- Materials teach concepts
- Process reveals ideas
- Failure produces knowledge
- Repetition deepens understanding

Philosophical practices:
- Drawing as thinking
- Performance as theory
- Installation as argument
- Process as investigation
- Collaboration as dialogue

Artist-philosophers:
- Bourgeois (psychoanalysis enacted)
- Smithson (entropy demonstrated)
- Weiner (language materialized)
- Abramović (presence explored)
- Eliasson (perception investigated)

Methods developed:
- Studio as laboratory
- Sketchbook as journal
- Exhibition as thesis
- Documentation as reflection
- Teaching as practice

Knowledge forms:
- Embodied knowing
- Material intelligence
- Visual reasoning
- Spatial thinking
- Temporal understanding

Academic tensions:
- Practice-based PhDs
- Research outputs
- Peer review questions
- Funding categories
- Publication formats

Digital philosophy-practice:
- Code as thought
- Networks as theory
- Interaction as idea
- Data as material
- Algorithm as method

Value argued:
- Thinking through hands
- Knowing through body
- Theory from below
- Concrete abstraction
- Living philosophy

Practice philosophy rejects division. Not illustration of pre-existing ideas but generation of new thought through making. Hand teaches brain. Material surprises mind. Art thinks.
