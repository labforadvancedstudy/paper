## Core Concepts by Abstraction Level

### L0: Direct Experience
- [[seeing_levels]] - Recognizing different abstractions
- [[feeling_overwhelm]] - When complexity exceeds grasp
- [[aha_moment]] - Sudden level understanding
- [[teaching_experience]] - Explaining across levels
- [[learning_jumps]] - Breakthrough moments

### L1: Basic Patterns
- [[abstraction]] - Simplifying while preserving essence
- [[levels]] - Discrete stages of organization
- [[hierarchy]] - Vertical organization
- [[patterns]] - Recurring structures
- [[relationships]] - Connections between elements

### L2: Structural Properties
- [[containment]] - Higher includes lower
- [[transcendence]] - Higher exceeds lower
- [[emergence]] - New from interaction
- [[nesting]] - Levels within levels
- [[boundaries]] - Level separations

### L3: Dynamic Processes
- [[level_climbing]] - Moving up abstraction
- [[level_descending]] - Moving down abstraction
- [[compression]] - Information reduction
- [[integration]] - Combining elements
- [[differentiation]] - Distinguishing levels

### L4: System Behaviors
- [[upward_causation]] - Lower creates higher
- [[downward_causation]] - Higher affects lower
- [[feedback_loops]] - Circular causality
- [[phase_transitions]] - Sudden reorganization
- [[self_organization]] - Spontaneous order

### L5: Cognitive Aspects
- [[understanding_levels]] - Stages of comprehension
- [[cognitive_load]] - Mental capacity limits
- [[level_blindness]] - Difficulty seeing other levels
- [[perspective_shifting]] - Changing abstraction view
- [[meta_cognition]] - Thinking about thinking

### L6: Universal Patterns
- [[scale_invariance]] - Pattern at all scales
- [[domain_independence]] - Works everywhere
- [[recursive_structure]] - Self-similar organization
- [[fractal_nature]] - Infinite detail
- [[universality]] - Fundamental principle

### L7: Meta Properties
- [[self_reference]] - HA explains HA
- [[bootstrapping]] - Building from nothing
- [[meta_patterns]] - Patterns of patterns
- [[recursive_depth]] - Levels of recursion
- [[incompleteness]] - Always more levels

### L8: Philosophical Implications
- [[reality_structure]] - How universe organizes
- [[consciousness_levels]] - Awareness hierarchies
- [[knowledge_organization]] - How we understand
- [[existence_layers]] - Being at different scales
- [[meaning_hierarchies]] - Significance levels

### L9: Foundational Questions
- [[why_hierarchical]] - Why not flat?
- [[origin_of_levels]] - Where do levels come from?
- [[necessity_vs_contingency]] - Must it be this way?
- [[limits_of_abstraction]] - How far can we go?
- [[ultimate_ground]] - Is there a bottom/top?

## Cross-Cutting Themes
- Teaching and learning
- Communication across levels
- Information and compression
- Order and complexity
- Unity and diversity
- Part and whole
- Local and global
- Simple and complex

## Meta-Observations
- HA studying HA
- Using hierarchy to understand hierarchy
- The tool examining itself
- Bootstrap paradoxes everywhere
- Incompleteness at every level
