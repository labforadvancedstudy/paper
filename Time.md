## Abstract
The subjective experience of time is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Existing dedicated and intrinsic models of time perception provide insights into the neural and cognitive bases of temporal processing but have limitations in accounting for the wide range of individual differences in subjective time experience. In this paper, we propose a novel hypothesis, the "brain clock" hypothesis, which suggests that individual differences in subjective time experience can be explained by the unique information processing speed of each person's brain. We argue that the human brain operates similarly to large language models (LLMs) and that the speed of information processing in the brain determines the subjective flow of time. Drawing upon insights from cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence, we propose a series of testable predictions and empirical tests of the hypothesis using behavioral, neuroimaging, and computational modeling approaches. The brain clock hypothesis offers a novel perspective on the nature of subjective time experience and highlights the importance of interdisciplinary research in unraveling the mysteries of human cognition. It has implications for understanding individual differences in cognition, mental health, and the development of artificial intelligence systems. The hypothesis may foster interdisciplinary communication and collaboration, deepening our understanding of the complex interactions between time, cognition, and the brain.

1. Introduction
The passage of time is a fundamental aspect of human experience, yet the factors that shape our subjective perception of time remain elusive. While physics has made remarkable progress in understanding the nature of time at the cosmic scale, the psychological mechanisms underlying the subjective flow of time are still poorly understood (Grondin, 2010). Why does time seem to fly when we are having fun, but drag on endlessly when we are bored or anxious? How do individuals differ in their experience of time, and what neural and cognitive factors contribute to these differences?

To address these questions, we propose a novel hypothesis, the "brain clock" hypothesis, which posits that the subjective experience of time is determined by the speed of information processing in the brain. Specifically, we suggest that each individual's brain has a unique "clock speed" that governs the rate at which neural computations are performed, analogous to the clock frequency of a computer processor. Individuals with faster brain clocks are hypothesized to experience time as passing more slowly, as they can process more information within a given interval, whereas those with slower brain clocks may perceive time as passing more quickly.

The brain clock hypothesis draws upon recent developments in cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence to offer a new perspective on the nature of subjective time experience. In particular, we propose that the human brain operates in a manner similar to large language models (LLMs), a class of artificial neural networks that have achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of natural language processing tasks (Brown et al., 2020). LLMs learn to process and generate language by optimizing their network architecture and connection weights based on vast amounts of training data, in a way that mirrors the optimization of neural circuits in the brain through experience-dependent plasticity.

We argue that individual differences in subjective time experience may arise from variation in the architectural and physiological parameters of neural networks in the brain, such as the speed and synchronization of neural oscillations, the efficiency of synaptic transmission, and the topology of functional connectivity patterns. These neural parameters are thought to be influenced by a range of factors, including genetics, development, experience, and neurochemical modulation, which may contribute to the wide diversity of subjective time experiences observed across individuals and cultures.

The brain clock hypothesis has important implications for our understanding of the neural basis of cognition, as well as for the development of artificial intelligence systems that can model and simulate human-like cognitive processes. By proposing a link between neural information processing speed and subjective time experience, the hypothesis offers a new framework for investigating the neural correlates of individual differences in cognition, from intelligence and creativity to psychopathology and neurodevelopmental disorders. Furthermore, the hypothesis suggests that designing AI systems with human-like cognitive architectures and processing speeds may be crucial for replicating the subjective experiences and flexible problem-solving abilities of human intelligence.

In this paper, we first review the current state of knowledge on the neural and cognitive bases of time perception, highlighting the limitations of existing models and the need for a new theoretical framework. We then introduce the brain clock hypothesis and discuss its key ideas and predictions, drawing upon relevant findings from cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. Next, we propose a series of empirical tests of the hypothesis using behavioral, neuroimaging, and computational modeling approaches. Finally, we discuss the implications of the hypothesis for our understanding of human cognition and the development of artificial intelligence, and outline future directions for research.

2. Neural and Cognitive Bases of Time Perception
2.1. Models of Time Perception
Current models of time perception can be broadly divided into two classes: dedicated and intrinsic models (Ivry & Schlerf, 2008). Dedicated models propose that time is processed by specialized neural circuits or modules that are distinct from those involved in other cognitive functions. The most influential dedicated model is the pacemaker-accumulator model (Treisman, 1963), which posits that a central pacemaker emits pulses at a regular rate, which are counted by an accumulator and compared to stored representations of time intervals in memory. The speed of the pacemaker is thought to be modulated by factors such as attention, arousal, and dopaminergic signaling, which can alter the subjective experience of time (Zakay & Block, 1995).

Another prominent dedicated model is the attentional-gate model (Zakay & Block, 1995), which emphasizes the role of attention in time perception. This model proposes that the accumulation of pacemaker pulses is regulated by an attentional gate, which opens wider when more attention is allocated to time, allowing more pulses to be counted. The attentional-gate model has been extended to a three-dimensional model (Zakay, 2014) that incorporates the effects of arousal and cognitive load on time perception.

In contrast, intrinsic models propose that time is an inherent property of neural dynamics and is processed by the same neural circuits that mediate other cognitive functions (Karmarkar & Buonomano, 2007). For example, the state-dependent network model (Buonomano & Maass, 2009) suggests that time is encoded in the evolving spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity within recurrent neural networks, without the need for dedicated timing mechanisms. Similarly, the striatal beat frequency model (Matell & Meck, 2004) proposes that time is encoded by the coincidence detection of oscillatory activity in cortico-striatal circuits, with different intervals represented by distinct patterns of neural synchronization.

While these models have provided valuable insights into the neural and cognitive mechanisms of time perception, they have limitations in explaining the wide range of individual differences in subjective time experience. Dedicated models struggle to account for the influence of non-temporal factors such as attention, emotion, and context on time perception, while intrinsic models lack a clear explanation for the precise quantification and comparison of time intervals. Moreover, neither class of models provides a satisfactory account of the striking variability in subjective time experience across individuals and cultures, or the neural basis of this variability.

The brain clock hypothesis offers a novel perspective that addresses some of these limitations. Unlike dedicated models, it proposes that time perception is an emergent property of the general speed and efficiency of neural information processing, rather than the product of specialized timing circuits. This allows the hypothesis to naturally account for the influence of non-temporal factors on time perception, as these factors can modulate the overall state of neural activity and thus the subjective flow of time.

Compared to intrinsic models, the brain clock hypothesis provides a more explicit and quantitative link between neural dynamics and the subjective experience of time. By positing that individual differences in subjective time perception arise from individual differences in neural processing speed and efficiency, the hypothesis offers a clear and testable explanation for the wide variability in temporal experience across individuals and cultures. Furthermore, the proposed correspondence between neural and subjective time scales allows for the precise quantification and comparison of temporal intervals, addressing a key limitation of intrinsic models.

The brain clock hypothesis also offers a fresh perspective on several temporal phenomena that have been challenging to explain with existing models. For example, the subjective expansion of time during threatening or emotionally salient events (Stetson et al., 2007) can be readily accounted for by the accelerated neural processing that accompanies heightened arousal and attention in these situations. Similarly, the subjective compression of time during repetitive or predictable stimulation (Pariyadath & Eagleman, 2007) can be explained by the increased efficiency and reduced processing demands of neural responses to expected inputs.

In summary, while the brain clock hypothesis shares some features with existing models of time perception, it offers a distinctive and integrative framework that addresses key limitations of dedicated and intrinsic models. By grounding time perception in the general speed and efficiency of neural information processing, the hypothesis provides a parsimonious and testable account of the variability and malleability of subjective time experience, as well as its relation to other cognitive processes. Empirical investigations of the brain clock hypothesis may therefore lead to novel insights and a more comprehensive understanding of the neural basis of time perception.

2.2. Neural Substrates of Time Perception
Neuroimaging and lesion studies have implicated a distributed network of brain regions in time perception, including the prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and hippocampus (Merchant et al., 2013). The prefrontal cortex, particularly the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, has been consistently activated in fMRI studies of time perception and is thought to play a key role in attentional modulation and working memory for time intervals (Lewis & Miall, 2006). The parietal cortex, especially the right inferior parietal lobe, has been implicated in the integration of temporal and spatial information and the representation of temporal magnitudes (Bueti & Walsh, 2009).

The basal ganglia, particularly the striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta, have been proposed to play a central role in time perception by providing a dopaminergic pacemaker signal that regulates the speed of neural oscillations and the flow of subjective time (Buhusi & Meck, 2005). Parkinson's disease, which is characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, is associated with impairments in time perception and reproduction (Harrington et al., 2011). The cerebellum has been implicated in the precise timing of short intervals in the millisecond range, as well as in the coordination of motor and perceptual timing (Ivry & Spencer, 2004).

At the cellular level, time perception has been linked to the dynamics of neural oscillations and the synchronization of neural activity across different frequency bands (Gu et al., 2015). For example, the striatal beat frequency model proposes that time intervals are encoded by the coincidence detection of oscillatory activity in cortico-striatal circuits, with different intervals represented by distinct patterns of neural synchronization (Matell & Meck, 2004). Similarly, the temporal scaling model suggests that time is encoded by the scaling of neural oscillations in the alpha and beta frequency ranges, with longer intervals associated with slower oscillations and shorter intervals with faster oscillations (Klimesch, 2012).

Despite these advances, the neural mechanisms underlying individual differences in subjective time experience remain poorly understood. While some studies have reported associations between individual differences in time perception and neural activity in regions such as the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia (Wiener et al., 2010), the specific neural parameters that give rise to these differences have not been clearly identified. Moreover, the neural basis of the wide cultural diversity in time experience, such as the tendency for some cultures to have a more relaxed and flexible attitude towards time compared to others (Levine, 1997), has not been systematically investigated.

3. The Brain Clock Hypothesis
3.1. Neural Information Processing Speed and Subjective Time Experience
The brain clock hypothesis proposes that the subjective experience of time is determined by the speed of information processing in the brain. Specifically, we suggest that each individual's brain has a unique "clock speed" that governs the rate at which neural computations are performed, analogous to the clock frequency of a computer processor. This clock speed is hypothesized to be a function of the temporal dynamics of neural activity, such as the frequency and synchronization of neural oscillations, as well as the efficiency of synaptic transmission and the topology of functional connectivity patterns.

Individual differences in brain clock speed are proposed to arise from a combination of genetic, developmental, and experiential factors that shape the temporal dynamics of neural activity. For example, genetic variations in ion channel function, neurotransmitter signaling, and synaptic plasticity may contribute to individual differences in neural oscillations and information processing speed (Meck et al., 2008). Developmental factors such as early sensory experience and critical period plasticity may also play a role in shaping the temporal dynamics of neural circuits (Buonomano & Maass, 2009). Moreover, experience-dependent plasticity throughout the lifespan may continue to modify the speed and efficiency of neural information processing, as evidenced by the effects of learning and expertise on temporal processing (Matthews & Meck, 2016).

The brain clock hypothesis makes several key predictions about the relationship between neural information processing speed and subjective time experience. First, individuals with faster brain clocks are predicted to experience time as passing more slowly, as they can process more information within a given interval. This may manifest as a greater ability to make fine-grained temporal discriminations, a more accurate perception of time intervals, and a more vivid and detailed experience of the present moment. In contrast, individuals with slower brain clocks may experience time as passing more quickly, as they process less information within a given interval, leading to a more coarse-grained and less detailed perception of time.

Second, the brain clock hypothesis predicts that subjective time experience should be malleable and dependent on the current state of neural activity. Factors that alter the speed and efficiency of neural information processing, such as attention, arousal, and neurochemical modulation, are expected to influence the subjective flow of time. For example, states of heightened attention and arousal, such as those induced by sudden threats or novel stimuli, may accelerate neural processing and produce a subjective slowing of time (Stetson et al., 2007). Conversely, states of low arousal and inattention, such as those associated with boredom or fatigue, may slow neural processing and produce a subjective speeding of time (Zakay, 2014).

Third, the brain clock hypothesis predicts that individual differences in subjective time experience should be associated with individual differences in cognitive abilities that depend on the speed and efficiency of neural information processing. For example, individuals with faster brain clocks may exhibit superior performance on tasks that require rapid temporal processing, such as musical rhythm perception (Rammsayer & Altenmüller, 2006), speech perception (Tallal et al., 1993), and visual motion detection (Mather et al., 2013). Moreover, individual differences in brain clock speed may contribute to individual differences in higher-order cognitive abilities such as working memory, executive function, and fluid intelligence, which rely on the rapid and efficient processing of information in neural circuits (Conway et al., 2003).

3.2. Similarities between the Human Brain and Large Language Models
The brain clock hypothesis draws upon recent developments in artificial intelligence, particularly the success of large language models (LLMs) in achieving human-like performance on a wide range of natural language processing tasks (Brown et al., 2020). LLMs are a class of artificial neural networks that are trained on vast amounts of text data to predict the probability of a given word or sequence of words based on the preceding context. By learning to optimize their network architecture and connection weights to minimize prediction error, LLMs can generate coherent and contextually appropriate linguistic outputs that closely resemble human language production.

We propose that the human brain operates in a manner analogous to LLMs, with neural circuits optimized to predict and generate patterns of activity that minimize prediction error based on prior experience. This optimization process is thought to occur through experience-dependent plasticity, such as Hebbian learning and synaptic scaling, which modify the strength and topology of synaptic connections to enhance the efficiency and speed of neural information processing (Hebb, 1949). Just as LLMs learn to generate linguistic outputs that are statistically similar to the patterns in their training data, the brain learns to generate patterns of neural activity that are statistically similar to the patterns experienced during development and learning.

The similarities between the human brain and LLMs extend beyond their common reliance on prediction and optimization principles. Both systems exhibit a hierarchical architecture, with successive layers of processing that transform raw sensory inputs into increasingly abstract and complex representations (Yamins & DiCarlo, 2016). Both systems also exhibit a high degree of recurrent connectivity, with feedback connections that allow for the dynamic shaping of neural activity based on prior expectations and context (Douglas et al., 1995). Moreover, both systems are characterized by a high degree of plasticity, with the ability to adaptively modify their structure and function in response to changes in the environment or task demands (Power & Schlaggar, 2017).

The brain clock hypothesis proposes that individual differences in subjective time experience may arise from individual differences in the architectural and physiological parameters of neural networks in the brain, analogous to the hyperparameters of LLMs. Just as different LLMs can exhibit different levels of performance and efficiency depending on their architecture, training data, and optimization algorithms (Brown et al., 2020), different brains may exhibit different speeds and efficiencies of information processing depending on their neural architecture, developmental history, and plasticity mechanisms. These individual differences in neural information processing speed are proposed to give rise to individual differences insubjective time experience, as well as cognitive abilities that depend on the rapid and efficient processing of information.

3.3. Empirical Predictions and Testable Hypotheses
The brain clock hypothesis generates several testable predictions that can be investigated using a combination of behavioral, neuroimaging, and computational modeling approaches. Here we outline a set of key empirical predictions and propose specific experimental designs to test them.

### Prediction 1: Individual differences in subjective time perception should be associated with individual differences in neural information processing speed.

To test this prediction, we propose a series of experiments that combine behavioral measures of time perception with neuroimaging measures of neural activity. For example, participants could be asked to perform a temporal discrimination task, such as judging whether a comparison interval is longer or shorter than a standard interval, while undergoing fMRI or EEG recording. Individual differences in temporal discrimination thresholds and neural activity patterns could then be analyzed to test for associations between behavioral and neural measures of temporal processing.

We predict that individuals with lower temporal discrimination thresholds (i.e., greater temporal sensitivity) should exhibit faster and more efficient neural information processing, as indexed by measures such as the power and synchronization of neural oscillations, the latency and amplitude of event-related potentials, and the strength and topology of functional connectivity patterns. Moreover, we predict that these neural measures should be selectively associated with temporal processing, rather than non-temporal factors such as attention or motivation, as demonstrated by appropriate control conditions and tasks.

### Prediction 2: Subjective time experience should be malleable and dependent on the current state of neural activity.

To test this prediction, we propose a series of experiments that manipulate the speed and efficiency of neural information processing using pharmacological, sensory, or cognitive interventions. For example, participants could be administered drugs that modulate neurotransmitter signaling, such as dopamine agonists or antagonists, while performing temporal perception tasks. Alternatively, participants could be exposed to sensory stimuli that are known to alter neural oscillations and synchronization, such as flickering lights or rhythmic sounds, while judging the duration of temporal intervals.

We predict that interventions that accelerate neural information processing, such as dopamine agonists or high-frequency sensory stimulation, should produce a subjective slowing of time, as indexed by longer duration estimates and higher temporal discrimination thresholds. Conversely, interventions that slow neural information processing, such as dopamine antagonists or low-frequency sensory stimulation, should produce a subjective speeding of time, as indexed by shorter duration estimates and lower temporal discrimination thresholds. These effects should be specific to temporal processing and not attributable to non-temporal factors such as changes in arousal or attention.

### Prediction 3: Individual differences in brain clock speed should be associated with individual differences in cognitive abilities that depend on the speed and efficiency of neural information processing.

To test this prediction, we propose a series of experiments that measure individual differences in brain clock speed using temporal perception tasks, and relate these measures to individual differences in cognitive abilities such as working memory, executive function, and fluid intelligence. For example, participants could complete a battery of cognitive tasks that assess different aspects of information processing speed, such as the n-back task, the Stroop task, and the Raven's Progressive Matrices, in addition to temporal discrimination tasks that measure brain clock speed.

We predict that individuals with faster brain clocks, as indexed by lower temporal discrimination thresholds and more efficient neural information processing, should exhibit superior performance on cognitive tasks that require rapid and accurate information processing. Specifically, we expect to find positive correlations between measures of brain clock speed and measures of working memory capacity, executive control, and fluid intelligence, even after controlling for potential confounding factors such as age, education, and motivation. These associations should be specific to cognitive abilities that depend on information processing speed, rather than crystallized knowledge or verbal abilities.

### Prediction 4: The subjective experience of time should be influenced by the hierarchical structure and recurrent dynamics of neural networks in the brain.

To test this prediction, we propose a series of experiments that manipulate the temporal structure and context of sensory inputs and examine their effects on subjective time perception. For example, participants could be presented with sequences of auditory or visual stimuli that vary in their temporal predictability, such as regular vs. irregular rhythms, or predictable vs. unpredictable sequences. Alternatively, participants could be exposed to stimuli that vary in their level of abstraction and complexity, such as simple tones vs. complex speech sounds, or geometric shapes vs. natural scenes.

We predict that subjective time perception should be influenced by the ability of neural networks to predict and generate patterns of activity that minimize prediction error based on the temporal structure and context of sensory inputs. Specifically, we expect that temporally predictable and regularly structured inputs should be associated with a subjective compression of time, as the brain can efficiently process and predict these patterns. In contrast, temporally unpredictable and irregularly structured inputs should be associated with a subjective expansion of time, as the brain requires more time and resources to process and predict these patterns. These effects should be modulated by the hierarchical level and complexity of the stimuli, with more abstract and complex stimuli requiring more extended processing and leading to greater subjective time dilation.

## 3.4. Implications and Future Directions
The brain clock hypothesis offers a novel and testable framework for understanding the neural basis of subjective time perception and its relation to other cognitive abilities. By linking individual differences in temporal experience to individual differences in neural information processing speed and efficiency, the hypothesis provides a mechanistic account of how the brain constructs the subjective flow of time. This account has important implications for both basic research on the neural basis of cognition and applied research on the diagnosis and treatment of temporal processing disorders.

At a basic research level, the brain clock hypothesis generates new questions and directions for investigating the neural basis of time perception and its relation to other cognitive processes. For example, future studies could investigate the developmental trajectory of brain clock speed and its relation to the maturation of neural networks and cognitive abilities across the lifespan. Studies could also examine the effects of learning and experience on brain clock speed and temporal processing, such as the influence of musical training or meditation practice on temporal discrimination abilities. Moreover, studies could explore the neural basis of individual differences in time perception across different sensory modalities and temporal scales, from milliseconds to minutes to hours.

At an applied research level, the brain clock hypothesis has potential implications for the diagnosis and treatment of temporal processing disorders, such as those associated with neurological and psychiatric conditions. For example, studies have shown that individuals with Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder exhibit impairments in temporal discrimination and duration estimation, which may be related to abnormalities in dopaminergic signaling and neural oscillations (Allman & Meck, 2012; Falter & Noreika, 2011; Haggard et al., 2002). The brain clock hypothesis suggests that these temporal processing deficits may arise from disruptions in the speed and efficiency of neural information processing, which could be targeted by pharmacological or behavioral interventions that modulate neural oscillations and synchronization.

Moreover, the brain clock hypothesis has potential implications for the development of brain-inspired artificial intelligence systems that can mimic human-like cognitive abilities. By understanding the neural basis of temporal processing and its relation to other cognitive processes, researchers could design artificial neural networks that incorporate biologically realistic temporal dynamics and hierarchical structures. These brain-inspired AI systems could potentially achieve human-like performance on tasks that require rapid and flexible information processing, such as natural language understanding, visual scene perception, and decision making under uncertainty.

In conclusion, the brain clock hypothesis offers a novel and promising framework for understanding the neural basis of subjective time perception and its relation to other cognitive abilities. By linking individual differences in temporal experience to individual differences in neural information processing speed and efficiency, the hypothesis provides a mechanistic account of how the brain constructs the subjective flow of time. This account generates testable predictions and new directions for research on the neural basis of cognition, as well as potential applications for the diagnosis and treatment of temporal processing disorders and the development of brain-inspired artificial intelligence systems. Future studies that test and expand upon the brain clock hypothesis have the potential to deepen our understanding of the complex interplay between time, cognition, and the brain.
