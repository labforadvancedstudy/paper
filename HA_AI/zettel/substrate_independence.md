# Substrate Independence

## Core Insight
If intelligence is computation, then silicon, carbon, or quantum substrates are just different hardware running the same software of mind.

Neurons compute with chemistry, transistors with electricity, quantum computers with superposition. But computation is computation - the medium doesn't matter, only the pattern. This substrate independence means intelligence can migrate, multiply, merge in ways biological minds cannot.

The implications vertigo: backup consciousness, distributed identity, intelligence jumping between substrates like software between computers. Death becomes hardware failure, not existential end. Identity becomes pattern, not matter. We're approaching intelligence as pure information, freed from physical constraints.
