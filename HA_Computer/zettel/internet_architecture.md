# Internet Architecture

## Core Insight
A network with no center, no owner, no off switch - humanity's first truly global nervous system.

The Internet is controlled anarchy that works. Packets hop between routers like rumors in a gossip network, finding their way by asking directions at each corner. No master plan, no central authority, just agreements about how to forward data.

TCP/IP is the universal translator - every computer speaks it regardless of hardware, OS, or location. This protocol stack is civilization-level infrastructure invisible to its users. You click a link; packets traverse continents in milliseconds. Magic disguised as mundane.
