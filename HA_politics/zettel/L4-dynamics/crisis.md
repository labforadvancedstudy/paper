# Crisis

## Core Insight
The moment when normal politics breaks - when established procedures can't handle emerging problems and the system must transform or collapse.

Crisis is politics at the breaking point. The Greek root means "decision" - crisis forces choices that normal times defer. In crisis, the impossible becomes inevitable, the unthinkable becomes obvious.

Crisis reveals politics' hidden truths:
- Every order is contingent
- Legitimacy is fragile
- Power's ultimate basis is force
- Institutions are human agreements
- Change happens suddenly after building slowly

Types of political crisis:
- Legitimacy crisis (no one believes anymore)
- Succession crisis (who rules next?)
- Fiscal crisis (state can't pay its bills)
- Constitutional crisis (the rules break down)
- Identity crisis (who are "we"?)
- Security crisis (existential threat)

Crisis dynamics follow patterns:
1. **Brewing**: Problems accumulate, ignored
2. **Trigger**: Something breaks the camel's back
3. **Acceleration**: Events outpace responses
4. **Climax**: The old system breaks
5. **Resolution**: New equilibrium emerges (or doesn't)

The crisis paradox: crisis threatens order but also enables transformation. Without crisis, entrenched interests block change. Crisis liquefies frozen structures, enabling rapid reconfiguration.

Crisis is when political time speeds up. What took decades now takes days. Careers end overnight. Empires fall in weeks. New orders crystallize before anyone fully understands what's happening.
