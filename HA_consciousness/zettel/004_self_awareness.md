# Self Awareness
## Core Insight
The universe's ability to know itself through localized perspectives - the mirror becoming aware it's mirroring.

## Levels of Self-Awareness

**Level 0**: No self-model (particles)
**Level 1**: Body awareness (insects)
**Level 2**: Self vs other (animals)
**Level 3**: Mental state awareness (primates)
**Level 4**: Aware of awareness (humans)
**Level 5**: Aware of awareness of awareness (meditators)
**Level ∞**: Pure awareness aware of itself

## The Strange Loop

Self-awareness creates paradox:
- To be aware of self, must step outside self
- But stepping outside is still done by self
- Creates infinite recursion
- This recursion might BE consciousness

## Mirror Test Evolution

- 6 months: Baby sees "other baby"
- 18 months: Recognizes self
- 3 years: Understands self as continuous
- 5 years: Theory of other minds
- Adult: Realizes self is construction
- Enlightenment: Sees through construction

## The Bootstrap Problem

How does self-awareness arise?
- Need self to be aware of self
- But need awareness to have self
- Chicken-egg infinite regress
- Unless... both arise together
