# Cognitive Dissonance

The mental discomfort of holding contradictory beliefs, leading us to spectacular feats of mental gymnastics to restore consistency.

## Festinger's Classic Study
People paid $1 to lie about boring task later rated it as more enjoyable than those paid $20. Why? The $1 group had to justify their lie internally: "I must have enjoyed it somewhat."

## Dissonance Triggers
- Behavior contradicts beliefs
- New information challenges worldview
- Making difficult decisions
- Effort justification (hazing â†’ group loyalty)

## Resolution Strategies
1. Change behavior (hardest)
2. Change belief (easier)
3. Add new beliefs (easiest)
4. Minimize importance

## Examples
- Smokers: "My grandfather smoked and lived to 90"
- Post-purchase: "This expensive car must be great"
- Failed predictions: "The real message was spiritual"
