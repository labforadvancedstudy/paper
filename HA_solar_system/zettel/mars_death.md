# Mars Death

## Core Insight
Mars is a planetary corpse that shows what happens when a world is too small to hold onto life's requirements - a frozen desert that once had rivers, teaching us that habitability can be lost.

Mars died slowly. Billions of years ago, it had thick atmosphere, liquid water, possibly life. Ancient river valleys and lake beds tell of warmer, wetter times. But Mars was doomed by its size - half Earth's diameter, one-tenth the mass. Too small to retain internal heat, its core cooled and solidified. The magnetic dynamo shut down. Without magnetic protection, solar wind stripped the atmosphere. Without atmospheric pressure, water couldn't remain liquid.

Today's Mars is a freeze-dried mummy. Water exists as ice at poles and permafrost underground. The thin atmosphere can't support liquid water - it sublimates directly from ice to vapor. Dust storms rage globally but carry little force. Mars teaches that planetary death is gradual - worlds don't die in catastrophe but slowly leak their life away. In Mars's preserved surface, we read the story of paradise lost to physics.
