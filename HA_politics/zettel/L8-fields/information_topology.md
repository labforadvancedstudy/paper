# Information Topology

## Core Insight
The shape of knowledge and ignorance in political space - how information flows, pools, and barriers create landscapes of awareness that determine what political actions are possible.

Information doesn't distribute evenly like gas in a container. It flows like water through social terrain, creating:
- **Floods** (media saturation points)
- **Deserts** (information voids)
- **Pools** (echo chambers)
- **Rapids** (viral cascades)
- **Dams** (censorship/paywalls)
- **Tributaries** (network pathways)

The topology shapes politics:
- Where information flows freely, coordination emerges
- Where it's blocked, fragmentation follows
- Where it pools, extremism breeds
- Where it's filtered, manipulation thrives

Consider how different groups inhabit different information universes:
- Urban/rural information watersheds
- Generational media ecosystems
- Language-based information islands
- Class-stratified knowledge access
- Professional information silos

Power often lies in shaping topology:
- Creating channels (media ownership)
- Building barriers (classification, censorship)
- Directing flows (algorithms, recommendations)
- Poisoning wells (disinformation)
- Controlling high ground (platform dominance)

The digital revolution didn't flatten information topology - it made it more complex. Instead of one mountain (mainstream media), we have thousands of hills (influencers, sub-communities). Instead of simple censorship, we have algorithmic shaping.

Political movements succeed by understanding and exploiting information topology. Arab Spring rode Facebook's network structure. Trump mastered Twitter's amplification dynamics. COVID conspiracy theories followed YouTube's recommendation paths.

The meta-question: as we become aware of information topology, does that change it? Can we consciously design better information landscapes, or are we always within the topology we're trying to map?
