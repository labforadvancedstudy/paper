# Mission Design

## Core Insight
The art of threading impossible constraints into a possible path - orchestrating physics, engineering, budgets, and politics into a choreographed dance that delivers spacecraft where they need to be, when they need to be there.

Mission design is where dreams meet physics and usually lose. It's the multidimensional optimization problem that turns "let's go to Mars" into a specific launch date, trajectory, spacecraft configuration, and operations plan. Every mission is a unique puzzle with non-unique solutions.

The constraint web:
- Orbital mechanics (when planets align)
- Launch vehicle capability (mass and volume limits)
- Spacecraft capabilities (delta-v, power, thermal)
- Communication windows (speed of light lag)
- Radiation environment (solar storms, Van Allen belts)
- Budget reality (always less than needed)
- Schedule pressure (launch windows don't wait)
- Risk tolerance (crew vs robotic)

The design spiral:
1. Define objectives (science? exploration? demonstration?)
2. Select trajectory (direct? gravity assists?)
3. Size spacecraft (propulsion, power, payload)
4. Verify feasibility (does physics allow?)
5. Iterate everything (something's always wrong)
6. Optimize trades (mass vs risk vs cost vs schedule)
7. Margins for reality (nothing goes as planned)

Types reveal priorities:
- Flagship missions: Maximum science, maximum cost
- Discovery class: Focused objectives, cost caps
- CubeSat swarms: Many cheap vs one expensive
- Human missions: Safety dominates everything
- Commercial: Profit drives design

Mission design is systems engineering made brutal by physics. Earth doesn't want to let go. Space doesn't forgive mistakes. Every decision cascades through the entire system.
