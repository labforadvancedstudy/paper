# Roles

## Core Insight
The social masks we wear that paradoxically both constrain and enable us to function in complex societies.

You're never just you. You're someone's child, parent, employee, customer, citizen. Each role comes with a script: parents nurture, employees work, customers pay. Switching roles is like changing costumes - same person, different performance.

The sociological insight: we ARE our roles more than we think. A shy person becomes authoritative as a teacher. A tough boss becomes gentle as a grandparent. The role shapes the person as much as the person shapes the role.

Modern life means juggling multiple roles, sometimes conflicting. Your boss asks you to fire your friend. Your parental role (provide) conflicts with your spouse role (be present). These role conflicts are where individual meets society most painfully.
