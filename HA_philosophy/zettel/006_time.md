# Time

## Core Insight
The dimension that creates stories from states - change's playground.

## The River That Might Not Flow

Time is philosophy's strangest puzzle. We live in it but can't point to it. We measure it but can't hold it. We remember the past, experience the present, anticipate the future - but physics says they all exist equally.

L1: Time is day and night
L2: Time is cycles of creation
L3: Time is the measure of change
L4: Time is a form of intuition
L5: Time is lived duration
L6: Time is entropy's arrow
L7: Time is a social construct
L8: Time is information flow
L9: Time is [∂/∂t vanishes]

McTaggart's paradox: the present is always becoming past, so when is now?
