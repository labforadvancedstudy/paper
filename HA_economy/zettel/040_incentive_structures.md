# Incentive Structures

## Core Insight
The invisible puppeteer: how reward systems shape behavior - show me the incentives, I'll show you the outcome.

Incentives are economics' remote control for human behavior. People respond to rewards and punishments, often in ways designers never intended. The structure matters more than intentions.

Incentive types:
- **Financial** - money talks
- **Social** - status and shame
- **Intrinsic** - internal satisfaction
- **Perverse** - encouraging opposite of intended
- **Cobra effects** - solution worsens problem

Incentive dynamics:
- What gets measured gets managed
- What gets rewarded gets repeated
- Multiple goals create conflicts
- Gaming always emerges
- Unintended consequences dominate

Classic failures:
- Paying for cobras → cobra breeding
- Teacher bonuses for test scores → teaching to test
- CEO stock options → short-term thinking
- Welfare cliffs → poverty traps

The profound truth: incentives are architecture. They create channels where behavior flows. Design incentives poorly, get poor results regardless of good intentions.

Understanding incentives means seeing the invisible forces shaping every decision.
