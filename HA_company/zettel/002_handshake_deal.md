# Handshake Deal

## Core Insight
The handshake transforms trust from feeling to fact, creating binding agreement through physical ritual - the original smart contract.

A handshake is technology. Ancient, biological, perfect. Two hands meet, grip, pump, release. In that moment, abstract agreement becomes physical reality. The deal exists because bodies touched.

Before lawyers, before contracts, before writing even - the handshake. It works because it's hard to deny what your body did. The physical memory reinforces the social contract. Breaking a handshake deal doesn't just violate agreement - it violates the memory in your palm.

Modern business pretends to transcend this with documents and digital signatures. But watch any major deal close: they still shake hands. The papers are for lawyers; the handshake is for humans. It says: "We're in this together now."
