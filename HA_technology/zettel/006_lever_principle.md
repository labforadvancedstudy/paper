# Lever Principle

## Core Insight
The lever reveals nature's hidden generosity: put the fulcrum in the right place, and a child can move mountains - physics offers mechanical advantage to those who understand geometry.

"Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world," said Archimedes. He wasn't boasting - he was stating physics. The lever transforms distance into force through the magic of rotation.

It's beautiful math: Force × Distance on one side equals Force × Distance on the other. Want more force? Trade distance. It's conservation of energy made visible, touchable, useful.

Every machine contains levers - obvious ones in pliers and seesaws, hidden ones in gears and engines. The principle scales: from tweezers to tower cranes, it's the same truth - mechanical advantage through geometric arrangement.
