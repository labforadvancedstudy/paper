# Spectroscopy Revolution

## Core Insight
When we learned to decode starlight's rainbow fingerprint, astronomy transformed from mapping positions to understanding composition - we could finally know what stars are made of without touching them.

In 1814, Joseph von Fraunhofer noticed dark lines in the Sun's spectrum. He catalogued hundreds, having no idea he'd discovered how to read the chemical signatures of stars. Each element absorbs specific wavelengths, creating unique spectral fingerprints. When starlight passes through stellar atmospheres, elements leave their marks as absorption lines.

The revolution came when Gustav Kirchhoff realized these lines matched laboratory spectra of known elements. Suddenly, the cosmos became a chemistry lab. Helium was discovered in the Sun before Earth. Spectroscopy revealed stellar temperatures, compositions, velocities (via Doppler shift), rotation rates, magnetic fields. It showed that stars are mostly hydrogen and helium, that the universe has consistent chemistry everywhere. What seemed impossible - knowing what distant stars contain - became routine. Light carries far more information than brightness and color.
