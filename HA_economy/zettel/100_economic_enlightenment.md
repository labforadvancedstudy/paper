# Economic Enlightenment

## Core Insight
Economic enlightenment is seeing through the illusion - recognizing that the economy is a game we're playing, not a law of nature, and we can change the rules whenever we achieve collective clarity.

Money is fiction. Property is convention. Corporations are imagination. Markets are rituals. The entire economy is a massively multiplayer game where we forgot we're playing. Economic enlightenment is remembering it's just a game.

But "just" doesn't mean unimportant. Games create reality. The economy game determines who eats, who dies, who flourishes. The fiction has real consequences. The illusion shapes everything. Seeing through it doesn't make it disappear - it makes you aware of your participation.

Buddhist economics glimpsed this. Right livelihood. Non-attachment to wealth. Seeing desire as suffering's root. But you can't escape economy by renunciation. Even monks need rice. Enlightenment isn't leaving the game but playing consciously.

The stages mirror spiritual awakening. First, believing the economy is real and immutable. Then, seeing it's human-made. Then, realizing you're complicit. Then, understanding you can't escape. Finally, playing with full awareness - using money without being used by it.

True economic enlightenment might be collective. When enough people see through the illusion simultaneously, it changes. Like fiat currency collapsing when confidence disappears. If we all realized together that the economy serves us, not vice versa, what new game would we play?

The ultimate koan: how do you transcend economics while still eating?
