# Networks

## Core Insight
Everything connects to everything - where art reveals itself as nodes and edges, influence flowing through invisible links, creating emergent behaviors no single element controls.

Network types in art:
- Social (artist connections)
- Conceptual (idea flows)
- Market (value chains)
- Digital (online platforms)
- Neural (AI systems)

Network properties:
- Nodes (actors/artworks)
- Edges (relationships)
- Centrality (influence)
- Clustering (communities)
- Scale-free (power laws)

Artworld networks:
- Gallery affiliations
- Collector circles
- Critical discourse
- Museum connections
- Biennial circuits

Digital network art:
- Net.art pioneers
- Social media performance
- Distributed creation
- Blockchain verification
- Platform aesthetics

Network effects:
- Viral propagation
- Influence cascades
- Echo chambers
- Filter bubbles
- Emergent consensus

Visualization reveals:
- Hidden connections
- Power concentrations
- Information flows
- Structural holes
- Bridge positions

Network thinking changes:
- Individual → relational
- Object → connection
- Static → dynamic
- Hierarchy → web
- Control → influence

Critical perspectives:
- Network exclusions
- Access inequalities
- Platform power
- Surveillance potential
- Manipulation risks

Future networks:
- Quantum entanglement
- Biological computing
- Hybrid physical/digital
- Interplanetary art
- Unknown topologies

Networks teach: No art exists in isolation. Value emerges from connection. Influence flows through structure. Position matters more than possession. We are the network.
