# Homo Economicus

## Core Insight
Homo economicus is economics' most useful fiction - a perfectly rational, self-interested, utility-maximizing automaton that exists nowhere but explains much.

This imaginary species has remarkable abilities. It has infinite computational power, perfect information, complete preferences, and unshakeable will. It calculates optimal choices instantly, never regrets, never doubts, never changes its mind. It's a decision-making god trapped in human form.

Economists know homo economicus is fake. But like physicists assuming frictionless spheres, the simplification enables analysis. Without it, economic models become intractable. How do you model beings who sometimes want chocolate, sometimes want to want vegetables, and sometimes want to not want anything?

The fiction works surprisingly well in aggregate. Individual irrationality often cancels out. Markets can be efficient even if traders aren't. The wisdom of crowds emerges from foolish individuals.

But homo economicus also blinds us. It can't explain volunteering, revenge, addiction, or love. It misses how context shapes choice, how emotions drive decisions, how social beings aren't atomic individuals.

Worse, the fiction becomes prescription. Students taught to think like homo economicus become more selfish. Policies assuming selfishness create selfishness. The model doesn't just describe - it shapes.

Homo economicus is a tool that became a master. Useful for building models, dangerous when we forget it's not human.
