# Arousal Regulation

Goldilocks principle: Not too high, not too low.

Yerkes-Dodson law:
- Simple task: Higher arousal better
- Complex task: Moderate arousal optimal
- Too high: Performance crashes

Regulation mechanisms:
- Sympathetic: Rev up
- Parasympathetic: Calm down

Individual differences:
- Introverts: Lower optimal arousal
- Extroverts: Higher optimal arousal
- Sensation seekers: Need intensity
