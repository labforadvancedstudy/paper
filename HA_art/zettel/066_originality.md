# Originality

## Core Insight
The impossible demand - where newness becomes fetish despite everything being always already done, creating anxiety that drives both innovation and its simulation.

Originality paradoxes:
- Everything influenced
- Nothing truly new
- Yet newness demanded
- Innovation valorized
- Copying condemned

Historical construction:
- Romanticism's genius
- Modernism's rupture
- Avant-garde's shock
- Postmodernism's death
- Contemporary confusion

Strategies for "newness":
- Combination (A + B = C)
- Context shift (relocate)
- Scale change (bigger/smaller)
- Material innovation
- Process invention

Originality anxieties:
- Influence vs. plagiarism
- Homage vs. copy
- Unconscious absorption
- Parallel invention
- Prior art discovery

Digital complications:
- Everything searchable
- Influences traceable
- Copying perfect
- Attribution complex
- AI mimicry

Market demands originality:
- Brand differentiation
- Investment protection
- Critical attention
- Historical importance
- Price justification

Alternative values:
- Iteration appreciated
- Tradition honored
- Craft excellence
- Community practice
- Shared authorship

Reality: Originality is recombination. Everything builds on everything. New contexts create new meanings. Execution matters as much as idea. Personality persists through influence.
