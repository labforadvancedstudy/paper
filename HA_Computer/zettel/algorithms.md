# Algorithms

## Core Insight
Recipes for computation - abstract procedures that transform input into output through precise steps.

An algorithm is a thought pattern made repeatable. "To sort: compare, swap if needed, repeat." It exists beyond any language, any machine. The same sorting algorithm works on paper, in Python, in your head, in DNA.

Algorithms reveal that computation isn't about computers - it's about process. Any system that can follow steps can compute. The universe itself might be running algorithms we call "physics." We're pattern-followers in a pattern-following cosmos.
