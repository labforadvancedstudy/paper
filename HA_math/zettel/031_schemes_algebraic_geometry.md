# Schemes and Modern Algebraic Geometry

## Core Insight
Schemes extend algebraic varieties by including "generic points" and nilpotents - revealing that geometry and algebra are two faces of the same mathematics.

## Content
Classical algebraic geometry studies zero sets of polynomials. Schemes revolutionized this by reversing the perspective: start with rings, build geometry from algebra.

The construction:
- Spec(R): prime ideals of ring R
- Topology: closed sets are algebraic sets
- Structure sheaf: functions are ring elements
- Local rings capture infinitesimal data

Why schemes matter:
- Work over any ring (not just fields)
- Include non-reduced structures (x² = 0)
- Generic points represent general position
- Fiber products exist

Examples show power:
- Spec(ℤ): integers as geometric object
- Proj(R): projective schemes
- Group schemes: algebraic groups
- Moduli spaces: schemes parametrizing schemes

The dictionary:
- Points ↔ Prime ideals
- Functions ↔ Ring elements
- Subschemes ↔ Ideals
- Morphisms ↔ Ring homomorphisms

Deep results:
- Grothendieck's cohomology theory
- Resolution of singularities (char 0)
- Wiles' proof of Fermat (modular forms)
- Motivic cohomology

Schemes revealed that algebra isn't just a tool for geometry - algebra IS geometry, viewed correctly.
