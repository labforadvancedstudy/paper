# Distributed System (Metaphorical View)
- **Level**: L5
- **Definition**: Multiple computers pretending to be one
- **Korean**: 분산 시스템
- **Context**: The grand illusion of unity across networked machines

*Note: For technical patterns and fallacies, see [[007_distributed_systems]]*

## Core Understanding
A distributed system is like a symphony orchestra where musicians sit in different cities, connected only by telephone, trying to play Beethoven's 9th in perfect synchronization. The miracle isn't that it sometimes fails—it's that it ever works at all.

## Deeper Insights
- **The CAP Theorem Reality**: You can have Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance—pick two, and pray
- **The Network is Not Reliable**: Eight fallacies of distributed computing, all learned through pain
- **Eventual Consistency**: The universe's way of saying "it'll work out... eventually"
- **Byzantine Generals**: When parts of your system actively lie to other parts

## Technical Details
```python
# The impossible dream of distributed consensus
def distributed_agreement(nodes):
    """
    Warning: This function contains more edge cases 
    than a dodecahedron made of razors
    """
    while not all_nodes_agree(nodes):
        for node in nodes:
            if node.is_alive() and node.can_communicate():
                node.gossip(node.state)
            elif node.is_partitioned():
                node.cry_silently()
            else:
                # Node is dead, but we might not know it yet
                schroedingers_node(node)
```

## Connection to Truth
Distributed systems teach us that truth itself is distributed—what's true on one node might be false on another, and both might be correct from their own perspectives. It's relativistic computing.

## When It Matters
- **System Design**: Where junior developers learn humility
- **Scalability**: When one computer just isn't enough suffering
- **Fault Tolerance**: Because failure isn't an option, it's a certainty
- **Modern Applications**: Everything is distributed now, resistance is futile

## Human Element
Building distributed systems is an exercise in accepting that you cannot control everything, cannot know everything, and must design for failure. It's surprisingly good preparation for life.
