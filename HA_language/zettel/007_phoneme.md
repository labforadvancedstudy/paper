# Phoneme

## Core Insight
The atom of sound - smallest unit that changes meaning.

## The Sound Matrix

Humans can produce hundreds of sounds, but each language uses only 20-50 as "meaningful" distinctions. English "p" and "b" are different phonemes (pit/bit), but in Arabic, they're variants of one sound.

Phoneme inventory:
- Hawaiian: ~13 phonemes (minimalist)
- English: ~44 phonemes (middle)
- !Xóõ: ~160 phonemes (maximalist, with clicks!)

Universal tendencies:
- All languages have vowels and consonants
- All have stops (p,t,k) and nasals (m,n)
- Most have /a/, /i/, /u/ vowels

L0: Pre-phonemic cries and calls
L1: Sound-meaning connections emerge
L2: Phoneme inventory stabilizes
L3: Phonological rules develop
L4: Sound changes propagate

The miracle: babies can learn ANY phoneme system, but lose ability by age 1.
