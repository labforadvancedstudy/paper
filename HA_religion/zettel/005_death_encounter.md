# Death Encounter

## Core Insight
The ultimate boundary experience - where all human meaning meets its limit and must leap or fall.

Standing beside the deathbed. Seeing the body empty of what made it them. The visceral knowing: this ends. This specific configuration of atoms and awareness will disperse. No theology needed to feel the vertigo.

Death encounter creates religion because:
- It demands explanation (where did they go?)
- It requires comfort (will I see them again?)
- It poses ultimate question (what was the point?)
- It threatens meaning (does anything matter if it ends?)
- It promises reunion or threatens separation

Every funeral is philosophy made urgent. The body is here but they are not. Where is "not here"? The mind cannot accept the extinction of love. So it posits continuation: heaven, reincarnation, ancestral presence, something, anything but nothing.

Watch a child at their first funeral. The questions tumble out: "Where is grandma? When is she coming back? Is she cold? Can she see us?" Adult theology is just these questions with footnotes.

Death is religion's first teacher and final exam.
