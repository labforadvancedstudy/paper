# Adoption Curves

## Core Insight
Technology spreads like infection through social networks - starting slow with innovators, accelerating through early adopters, then cascading through the mainstream before dying with laggards.

The S-curve is technology's signature: slow start (innovation), rapid rise (adoption), plateau (saturation). It's logistic growth - exponential expansion constrained by finite markets. Every technology from printing press to TikTok follows this pattern.

The chasm between early adopters and mainstream is where most technologies die. Early adopters buy vision; mainstream buys solution. Crossing requires transformation from "cool possibility" to "boring necessity." It's puberty for products.

Understanding adoption curves is understanding human psychology at scale. Innovators seek novelty, early adopters seek advantage, mainstream seeks safety, laggards seek familiarity. Technology succeeds by sequentially satisfying these different species of human.
