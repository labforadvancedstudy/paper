# Formal Analysis

## Core Insight
Looking as discipline - where systematic attention to visual elements reveals how meaning emerges from material choices, teaching the eye to see beyond subject to structure.

Formal analysis examines:
- Line quality and direction
- Shape relationships
- Color interactions
- Texture variations
- Spatial arrangements
- Compositional structures

Method follows pattern:
- Description (what's there)
- Analysis (how it works)
- Interpretation (why it matters)
- Evaluation (does it succeed)
- Context (when necessary)

Tools for seeing:
- Squinting (values visible)
- Upside-down viewing (composition clear)
- Detail isolation (quality apparent)
- Distance varying (scale effects)
- Time taking (slow looking)

Historical development:
- Wölfflin's paired concepts
- Fry's significant form
- Greenberg's flatness
- Krauss's grids
- Contemporary expansions

Criticisms accumulate:
- Eurocentrism embedded
- Context ignored
- Politics erased
- Meaning reduced
- Access assumed

Yet value persists:
- Trains attention
- Reveals craft
- Enables comparison
- Builds vocabulary
- Deepens pleasure

Digital challenges method:
- Screen viewing different
- Resolution varies
- Color unreliable
- Scale lost
- Texture absent

Contemporary formal analysis expands: includes time, interaction, network effects, code structure, social form. Everything has form. Form carries meaning. Analysis reveals both.
