# Pleasure Reward

## Core Insight
Pleasure is nature's "yes" - the carrot to pain's stick.

Where pain says "stop," pleasure whispers "more." It's the dopamine surge when you eat, the oxytocin flood during a hug, the endorphin rush after exercise. Pleasure isn't just feeling good - it's evolution's way of training us toward survival behaviors. But here's the twist: we've hacked our own reward system. Sugar hits harder than fruit ever did. Likes trigger dopamine meant for real social bonds.
