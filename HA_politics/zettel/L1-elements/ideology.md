# Ideology

## Core Insight
The lens through which political reality is viewed - a comprehensive worldview that explains what is, what should be, and how to get from one to the other.

Ideology is more than just ideas. It's a complete package:
- Diagnosis (what's wrong with the world)
- Vision (how the world should be)
- Strategy (how to create change)
- Identity (who we are, who they are)
- Emotion (what to feel about it all)

Every ideology claims to describe reality while actually constructing it. Marxists see class struggle everywhere. Liberals see individual freedom. Conservatives see tradition under threat. They're not wrong - ideology creates the reality it describes.

Ideology works through:
- Simplification (complex reality → clear story)
- Naturalization (contingent → inevitable)
- Moralization (political → ethical)
- Mobilization (thought → action)
- Immunization (defending against criticism)

The paradox: those most ideological often claim to be non-ideological. "I'm just being realistic" or "It's just common sense" are ideology's favorite disguises. The most powerful ideology is the one that doesn't appear to be ideology at all.

Yet we cannot escape ideology. To think politically is to think ideologically. Even anti-ideology is an ideology. The question isn't whether to be ideological, but whether to be conscious of our ideology.
