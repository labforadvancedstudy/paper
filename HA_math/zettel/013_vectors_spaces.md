# Vectors and the Geometry of Space

## Core Insight
Vectors extend numbers from "how much" to "how much and which way" - mathematics with direction.

## Content
A vector is deceptively simple: magnitude and direction. But this simplicity enables us to algebraize geometry and geometrize algebra.

Vectors can represent:
- Physical displacement: 3 km northeast
- Forces: 10 N downward
- Velocities: 60 mph west
- Abstract states: [temperature, pressure, humidity]

Vector operations encode geometric truths:
- Addition: tip-to-tail chaining
- Scalar multiplication: stretching/shrinking
- Dot product: projection and angles
- Cross product: perpendicularity and area

But the real power is vector spaces - sets where vectors live:
- ℝ² - the familiar plane
- ℝ³ - physical space
- ℝⁿ - arbitrary dimensions
- Function spaces - infinite dimensions
- Hilbert spaces - quantum states

Vector spaces must satisfy axioms:
- Closure under addition and scaling
- Associativity and commutativity
- Identity and inverse elements
- Distributivity

These axioms seem arbitrary until you realize: they're exactly what's needed for linear algebra to work. Matrices multiply vectors, transformations preserve structure, and geometry becomes computation.

Vectors taught us that geometry isn't about pictures - it's about relationships.
