# Evolution

## Core Insight
The process by which life explores the space of possible forms - a blind search algorithm that discovers solutions to problems it doesn't know exist.

Evolution isn't progress toward a goal - it's exploration without a map. Each organism is an experiment: "What happens if we try THIS?" Most experiments fail. The few that work become the launching pad for new experiments. It's innovation by trial and error on a cosmic scale.

The mechanism is absurdly simple: make copies with occasional errors, see what survives. But the results are absurdly complex: eyes that see, wings that fly, brains that think about evolution. No engineer could design what evolution stumbles upon through pure persistence.

Time is the secret ingredient. Given enough generations, the impossible becomes inevitable. A light-sensitive spot becomes an eye. A fin becomes a leg. An ape becomes an astronomer. Each step is tiny, but a billion tiny steps can climb any mountain.

The strangest part: evolution evolves. Sexual reproduction speeds up the search. Modularity allows mixing and matching. Development systems allow bigger changes. Evolution discovers better ways to evolve. It's a search algorithm improving its own search strategy while searching.
