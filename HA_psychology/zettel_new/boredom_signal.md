# Boredom Signal

## Core Insight
Boredom is your brain's check engine light - warning that you're wasting precious learning time.

That restless, empty feeling isn't laziness - it's your opportunity detector misfiring. Boredom physically hurts because stagnation meant death to our ancestors. Kids can't sit still because their brains demand maximum input for development. Adults doom-scroll because even junk information beats the pain of mental idle. It's not about having nothing to do - it's about doing nothing meaningful.
