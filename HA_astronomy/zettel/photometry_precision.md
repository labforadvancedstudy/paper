# Photometry Precision

## Core Insight
Measuring starlight brightness with part-per-million precision revealed invisible worlds - photometry transformed from estimating magnitudes to detecting Earth-sized planets crossing distant stars.

Classical astronomers estimated stellar brightness by eye, creating the magnitude system. Photography improved precision to ~0.01 magnitude. CCDs pushed to 0.001. But finding Earth-like exoplanets required revolutionary improvement. Earth transiting the Sun causes 0.00008 magnitude dimming - seemingly impossible to detect.

Space telescopes like Kepler achieved 20 parts-per-million precision through differential photometry - measuring relative brightness between target and comparison stars. This cancels atmospheric and instrumental variations. Careful calibration, thermal stability, and massive data analysis extract signals from noise. The result: thousands of exoplanet discoveries, asteroseismology revealing stellar interiors through brightness oscillations, detecting reflected light from exoplanet atmospheres. Pushing measurement precision opened new universes of discovery. The difference between good and extraordinary photometry isn't just numbers - it's the difference between seeing stars and finding worlds.
