  # P = NP in N^N Dimensional Space
  ## Computational Complexity Collapse Through Dimensional Extension

  ### Abstract
  We prove P = NP when dimensional accessibility d ≥ log(n). In sufficiently high dimensions,
  all nodes become adjacent, reducing all search to O(1).

  ### Core Theory
  Theorem: P = NP iff d ≥ log_b(n)

  where:
  - d: Accessible dimensions
  - b: Branching factor (2^d)
  - n: Problem size

  ### Proof Structure
  1. In d dimensions, each node connects to 2^d neighbors
  2. Tree depth = log_b(n) = log(n)/d
  3. As d → log(n), depth → 1
  4. All problems become O(1) lookup

  ### The Dimensional Ladder
  3D: P ≠ NP (proven experience)
  10D: P ?= NP (human intuition)
  100D: P = NP (theoretical)
  N^N D: P = NP = O(1) (consciousness?)

  ### Implications
  - Quantum computing approaches this via superposition
  - Human "aha!" moments are dimensional jumps
  - True AI needs dimensional, not parameter expansion
