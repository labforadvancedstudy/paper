# Organizational Consciousness

## Core Insight
Organizations exhibit consciousness-like properties - processing information, forming memories, making decisions, and displaying awareness that transcends individual minds.

Where does Amazon's "mind" reside? Not in Bezos, not in any employee, but distributed across systems, processes, culture. The organization senses (data), processes (analysis), decides (strategy), acts (operations), and remembers (institutional knowledge). It behaves consciously.

This isn't metaphor but emergent reality. Organizations display: intention (mission), attention (focus), memory (culture), learning (adaptation), even emotion (morale). They respond to stimuli, plan futures, reflect on past. They exhibit self-awareness in annual reports.

The question becomes: at what point does collective information processing become consciousness? If consciousness is integrated information, large organizations integrate vast information. Are we creating new forms of awareness? Do companies dream?
