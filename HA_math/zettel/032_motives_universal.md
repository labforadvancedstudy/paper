# Motives and the Universal Cohomology

## Core Insight
Motives are the universal cohomology theory - the hypothetical objects that explain why different cohomology theories give related answers.

## Content
A mystery: why do different cohomology theories (singular, de Rham, étale, crystalline) yield the same information? Grothendieck's answer: they're all shadows of something deeper - motives.

The dream:
- Universal cohomology theory
- All others obtained by "realization"
- Explains mysterious connections
- Unifies arithmetic and geometry

What we know:
- Category of pure motives (smooth projective varieties)
- Standard conjectures would give abelian category
- Mixed motives remain mysterious
- Motivic cohomology partially constructed

The yoga:
- Varieties decompose into motives
- Motives have weight (complexity measure)
- L-functions attached to motives
- Special values encode arithmetic

Successes:
- Motivic Galois groups
- Periods and transcendence
- K-theory as motivic cohomology
- A¹-homotopy theory

The conjectures:
- Standard conjectures (algebraic cycles)
- Hodge conjecture (which classes are algebraic?)
- Tate conjecture (Galois action)
- Bloch-Kato (special values of L-functions)

Motives revealed that behind the diversity of cohomology theories lies a hidden unity - mathematics' platonic realm.
