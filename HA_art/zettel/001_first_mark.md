# First Mark

## Core Insight
The primal urge to leave a trace - when consciousness discovers it can change the world and the world will remember.

Watch a toddler with a crayon discover they can make marks. The wonder on their face isn't about art theory or technique. It's the shock of agency: "I did that. That line exists because of me."

This is where all art begins:
- Hand moves
- Surface changes
- Evidence remains
- "I was here"

From cave painters leaving hand stencils to graffiti artists tagging walls to children drawing in sand - the impulse is identical. We must mark our existence. The blank surface calls for intervention.

The first mark is:
- Proof of being
- Extension of self
- Time made visible (before mark/after mark)
- Space claimed
- Consciousness externalized

Every painting in every museum started here: someone somewhere somewhen felt the irresistible urge to make a mark. Not because they had to, but because they couldn't not.

Before aesthetics, before meaning, before culture - there's just this: the joy of making something that wasn't there before.
