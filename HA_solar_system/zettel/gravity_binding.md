# Gravity Binding

## Core Insight
The Solar System is a gravitational symphony where every mass pulls every other mass, creating a web of invisible forces that turns chaos into clockwork.

Gravity is the Solar System's sculptor. It gathered dust into planets, holds moons in thrall, keeps Earth at the perfect distance for life. Every object tugs on every other - Jupiter pulls Earth, Earth pulls Jupiter, both pull the Sun, and the Sun pulls back. This mutual pulling creates a dynamic equilibrium, a dance where partners never touch but never part.

The binding goes deeper than orbits. Gravity creates tides, synchronizes rotations, shepherds asteroids, captures comets. It's weak compared to other forces but wins through persistence and reach. While electromagnetism cancels out, gravity only adds. Every atom contributes to the gravitational web binding the Solar System into a coherent whole. We're not just near the Sun; we're bound to it, and it to us.
