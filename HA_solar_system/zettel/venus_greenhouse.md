# Venus Greenhouse

## Core Insight
Venus shows what happens when greenhouse effect runs away - a cautionary tale where Earth's twin became a suffocating hell through positive feedback loops that turned paradise into perdition.

Venus should be Earth-like. Similar size, similar composition, similar distance from Sun (relatively). But surface temperature reaches 462°C - hot enough to melt lead. Atmospheric pressure crushes at 92 times Earth's. The culprit: runaway greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide comprises 96% of atmosphere. Solar energy enters but can't escape. The more heating, the more CO2 released from rocks, the more heating - a positive feedback spiral to hell.

Venus lost the climate lottery. Perhaps it started with slightly more solar heating. Oceans evaporated. Water vapor (a greenhouse gas) amplified warming. UV light split water; hydrogen escaped to space. Without water, no way to lock carbon into rocks. All carbon entered atmosphere as CO2. Venus teaches the knife-edge balance of habitability. Small changes cascade into different worlds. In Venus's crushing embrace, we see Earth's possible future if we're not careful.
