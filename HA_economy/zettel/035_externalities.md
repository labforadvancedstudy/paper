# Externalities

## Core Insight
The economic spillovers: when your actions affect my life without permission or payment - market failure incarnate.

Externalities are economics' blind spot. The factory pollutes the river, affecting downstream fishermen who aren't part of the transaction. Benefits and costs leak outside market boundaries.

Externality types:
- **Negative externalities** - pollution, noise, congestion
- **Positive externalities** - education, vaccination, research
- **Production externalities** - factory smoke
- **Consumption externalities** - secondhand smoke
- **Network externalities** - phone value rises with users

Externalities break markets because:
- Prices don't reflect true costs/benefits
- Too much bad stuff produced
- Too little good stuff produced
- Private and social incentives misalign
- Invisible victims/beneficiaries

Solutions attempted:
- Taxes on bads (carbon tax)
- Subsidies for goods (education funding)
- Regulations (emission standards)
- Property rights (cap and trade)
- Social pressure (shame polluters)

The deep problem: in interconnected world, everything has externalities. My breathing affects your air. Complete internalization is impossible.
