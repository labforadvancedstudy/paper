# Machine Learning Paradigms
## Core Insight
Different learning paradigms reflect different aspects of how intelligence acquires knowledge - supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement.

## Supervised Learning

**Teacher provides answers**:
- Input → Output pairs
- Learn the mapping
- Generalize to new inputs

Like school:
- Image → "Cat"
- Symptoms → Disease
- Text → Sentiment

Powerful but needs labels.

## Unsupervised Learning

**Find structure without labels**:
- Clustering similar things
- Reducing dimensions
- Finding patterns
- Generating new data

Like exploration:
- Customer segments
- Topic discovery
- Anomaly detection
- Data compression

Discovers what we didn't know to look for.

## Reinforcement Learning

**Learn from consequences**:
- Take action
- Observe reward
- Update strategy
- Repeat

Like life:
- Games (chess, Go)
- Robotics
- Trading
- Recommendation

Learns through experience.

## Emerging Paradigms

**Self-supervised**: Create own labels
**Few-shot**: Learn from few examples
**Meta-learning**: Learn to learn
**Continual**: Learn without forgetting
**Federated**: Learn without centralizing

Evolution of learning itself.

## The Convergence

Best systems combine all:
- Pre-train unsupervised (foundation)
- Fine-tune supervised (specialization)
- Adapt with reinforcement (optimization)

Like human learning.
