## Where It All Comes Together

The Global Workspace Theory proposes consciousness
arises when information becomes globally available
across the brain - the neural United Nations.

### The Workspace Metaphor
- Specialized processors compete for access
- Limited capacity "workspace"
- Winners become conscious
- Losers remain unconscious processes

### Neural Implementation
- Long-range connections between regions
- Thalamocortical loops maintain states
- Prefrontal cortex as workspace manager
- Global broadcasting through synchrony

### The Consciousness Threshold
Information becomes conscious when:
- It achieves global access
- Multiple regions can use it
- It persists beyond initial stimulus
- It becomes reportable experience

### From Irritability to Awareness
The journey complete:
- From single cell responses
- Through networked integration
- To global unified experience
- Life achieving consciousness of itself
