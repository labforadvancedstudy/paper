# Ego Boundaries

## Core Insight
The self is a fence your brain builds - but the property lines are negotiable.

Where do "you" end and "not you" begin? Your clothes feel like part of you when worn. Your car becomes an extension when driving. Lovers feel like one being. Crowds dissolve individual boundaries. The ego isn't fixed - it expands and contracts based on identification. That's why insults to your team hurt like personal attacks. The brain draws and redraws the circle of self constantly.
