# Closed Ecosystems

## Core Insight
Closed ecosystems for interstellar travel must replicate Earth's entire biosphere in miniature - not just keeping humans alive but maintaining the complex web of life that makes human existence possible.

Biosphere 2 taught us humility. Eight people, 3.14 acres, two years - and it nearly failed. Oxygen dropped. CO2 spiked. Ecosystems crashed. And that was on Earth with emergency backup. Now imagine maintaining this for centuries in deep space.

The requirements cascade:
- Primary producers: Plants, algae, bacteria
- Decomposers: Breaking down waste
- Pollinators: Many plants need them
- Soil microbiome: Trillions of organisms
- Nitrogen fixers: Keeping soil fertile
- Atmospheric processors: O2/CO2 balance
- Water recycling: 100% efficiency needed
- Nutrient cycles: Nothing can be lost

The hidden complexities:
- Genetic diversity to prevent collapse
- Predator-prey balance without extinctions
- Disease management without pesticides
- Seasonal cycles in artificial environment
- Psychological need for nature
- Backup systems for every organism

Failed ecosystem = dead colony. There's no calling for supplies. No opening windows for fresh air. Every species is critical infrastructure. Every extinction is a system failure.

Generation ships aren't just carrying humans to the stars - they're carrying pieces of Earth's biosphere, hoping they remember how to work together.
