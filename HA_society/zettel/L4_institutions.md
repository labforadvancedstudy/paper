# Institutions

## Core Insight
Social patterns that outlive their creators - the DNA of society that reproduces itself across generations.

Marriage, schools, courts, hospitals - institutions are solutions to recurring problems that became permanent. They're social fossils, preserving ancient answers to "how should we...?" questions. How should we raise children? School. Resolve disputes? Courts. Transfer property? Marriage and inheritance.

The institutional paradox: created to serve human needs, they often end up shaping humans to serve institutional needs. Schools designed to educate create students designed to be schooled. Hospitals designed to heal create patients.

Institutions achieve immortality through ritual and role. New people slip into old positions, performing ancient ceremonies, and the institution lives on. The judge dies, but the court remains.
