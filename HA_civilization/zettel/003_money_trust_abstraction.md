# Money Trust Abstraction

Barter: Direct value exchange, doesn't scale.
Money: Abstract value storage, infinite scale.

The abstraction:
- Intrinsic value → Symbolic value
- Physical limits → Numerical limits
- Trust in object → Trust in system

Money = Civilization's API for value transfer.
Works because everyone believes it works.
