# 008 Cephalization - Head Concentration

The evolutionary trend toward head-ward migration of nervous tissue.
Where senses cluster, processing follows.

## Driving Forces
- Bilateral symmetry → directional movement
- Sensory organs at leading edge
- Need for rapid integration
- Mouth location (food detection)

## Timeline
- 600 mya: First bilateral animals
- 550 mya: Simple eyespots + neural concentration
- 500 mya: True heads with sense organs
- 400 mya: Vertebrate brain plan established

## Advantages
- Reduced signal delay (sensors near processor)
- Centralized control
- Protected location (skull evolution)
- Integrated sensory processing

## Result
The head becomes the body's mission control. Consciousness
needs a command center.
