# Relational Aesthetics

## Core Insight
Social forms as art forms - where human interaction becomes the medium, relationships replace objects, and the gallery transforms into a space for constructed social experiences.

Bourriaud's theory identifies:
- Art as social interstice
- Micro-utopias created
- Participation essential
- Process over product
- Conviviality valued

Key practitioners:
- Tiravanija (cooking meals)
- Gillick (discussion platforms)
- Huyghe (complex ecosystems)
- Gonzalez-Torres (give-aways)
- Seghal (constructed situations)

Methods employed:
- Cooking/sharing food
- Creating meeting spaces
- Organizing events
- Facilitating exchange
- Building temporary communities

Criticisms sharp:
- Service aesthetics
- Neoliberal alignment
- Feel-good politics
- Exclusion hidden
- Labor exploited

Bishop's antagonism counter:
- Disruption over harmony
- Conflict productive
- Democracy agonistic
- Comfort questioned
- Politics returned

Contemporary mutations:
- Social practice expanded
- Instagram as relational
- Zoom performances
- Discord communities
- DAO collaborations

Questions persist:
- Is everything social art?
- Quality criteria?
- Documentation problem
- Ethical responsibilities
- Sustainability issues

Yet insight valuable: Art happens between people, not just objects. Relations can be composed like colors. Social choreography possible. Connection itself aesthetic.
