# Conglomerate Logic

## Core Insight
Conglomerates are meta-companies - organizations that own organizations, creating value through portfolio management rather than operational synergy.

The logic seems paradoxical: unrelated businesses under one roof. But conglomerates arbitrage inefficient markets. They move capital better than external markets. They share intangible assets: management talent, financial engineering, government relations. Diversification itself becomes value.

History cycles on conglomerates. 1960s: conglomerate boom. 1980s: "focus" and breakups. 2000s: tech conglomerates emerge. Each era rediscovers that sometimes 2+2=5 through financial engineering, talent allocation, or platform effects. Sometimes it equals 3 through bureaucracy.

Modern conglomerates differ. Alphabet isn't random accumulation but technology platform extending tentacles. Amazon isn't retail but infrastructure monetized many ways. The new conglomerate logic: shared capabilities, not just shared capital.
