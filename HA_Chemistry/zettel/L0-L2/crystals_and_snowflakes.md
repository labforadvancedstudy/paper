# Crystals and Snowflakes

## Core Insight
Molecules arranging themselves into perfect patterns - nature's geometry emerging from invisible forces, creating visible order.

Grow salt crystals from water - perfect cubes emerge. Each snowflake unique but six-sided. Sugar crystals, quartz crystals, frost on windows. Children marvel at the patterns, not knowing they're seeing molecular architecture.

This is self-assembly at its purest. Salt's sodium and chloride ions pack into cubic lattices because that's the most stable arrangement for their sizes and charges. Water molecules in snowflakes hydrogen-bond into hexagonal patterns, building fractals in the sky.

The magic is that no one directs this. No tiny architect arranges atoms. The forces between particles - attraction, repulsion, the sizes of atoms - determine everything. Given the right conditions, chaos becomes crystal.
