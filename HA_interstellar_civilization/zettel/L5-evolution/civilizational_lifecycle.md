# Civilizational Lifecycle

## Core Insight
Interstellar civilizations might follow predictable lifecycles - birth, expansion, maturity, and transformation or death - with each phase spanning millennia and visible across light-years to those who know the signs.

The pattern emerges from physical constraints and psychological constants:

**Phase 1: Planetary Adolescence** (0-1,000 years post-industry)
- Energy mastery on home world
- First space ventures
- Population peaks
- Sustainability crisis
- First signals leak to space

**Phase 2: System Expansion** (1,000-10,000 years)
- Home system colonized
- Resource extraction mature
- Stable space economy
- Interstellar planning begins
- Intentional signals possible

**Phase 3: First Waves** (10,000-100,000 years)
- Generation ships launch
- Nearest stars targeted
- Home system fully utilized
- Culture begins fragmenting
- Light-lag governance emerges

**Phase 4: Stellar Network** (100,000-1 million years)
- Multiple systems colonized
- Speciation begins
- Trade networks establish
- Cultural divergence accelerates
- Possible detection by others

**Phase 5: Transformation** (1+ million years)
- Post-biological transition?
- Inward turn (virtual realities)?
- Galactic engineering?
- Transcendence?
- Extinction?

The lifecycle might be why we see no one - civilizations are only "loud" during brief phases, then they transform into something we can't recognize or die trying.
