# Working Memory

Mind's RAM. Limited capacity.

Magic number: 7±2 items.
Or really 4±1 chunks.

Components (Baddeley):
- Phonological loop: Inner voice
- Visuospatial sketchpad: Mind's eye
- Central executive: The boss
- Episodic buffer: Integration

Chunking expands capacity.
Phone numbers: 555-1234 not 5551234.

Gateway to long-term memory.
Bottleneck of cognition.
