# Critical Periods: Development Windows

**Core Concept**: Certain abilities must develop during specific time windows or they're permanently impaired.

## One-Line Definition
Biology opens brief windows for learning - miss them and the window closes forever.

## Simple Mental Model
Like wet cement that hardens - you can only shape it while it's soft. Once it sets, major changes become impossible.

## Key Mechanism
1. Neural circuits primed for specific input
2. Experience shapes connections
3. Synaptic pruning locks in patterns
4. Window closes, plasticity reduces

## Practical Example
Children who don't hear language before age 7 never fully develop normal speech. Their brain's language cement has hardened without proper molding.

## Common Misconception
Critical periods are absolute cut-offs. Actually, they're more like dimmer switches - learning becomes harder, not impossible, as the window closes.
