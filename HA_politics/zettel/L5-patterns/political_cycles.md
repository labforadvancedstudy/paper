# Political Cycles

## Core Insight
The eternal return in politics - patterns that repeat across centuries and civilizations, as if political time moves in spirals rather than lines.

Politics has rhythms:
- Concentration → Dispersal → Concentration
- Order → Decay → Crisis → New Order
- Reform → Reaction → Revolution → Restoration
- Expansion → Overreach → Contraction → Renewal

These aren't laws like gravity, but tendencies like weather. The same patterns appear at different scales:
- Daily: the news cycle's outrage and forgetting
- Electoral: pendulum swings between parties
- Generational: idealism → pragmatism → cynicism → idealism
- Civilizational: rise → peak → decline → transformation

Why cycles? Perhaps because:
- Human nature has constants (fear, greed, hope)
- Power corrupts predictably
- Each generation must learn old lessons anew
- Solutions create new problems
- Memory fades

The cycle insight is both depressing and liberating. Depressing: we're trapped in repetition. Liberating: bad times end, good times return, nothing is permanent.

But spirals, not circles. Each cycle carries forward something from the last. Democracy today isn't Athenian democracy. Modern revolutions learned from previous ones. We repeat, but with variations.
