# Documentation

## Core Insight
The trace that becomes the work - where records of ephemeral art gain independent life, raising questions about what constitutes the "real" artwork in an age of reproduction.

Documentation types:
- Photography (still capture)
- Video (time-based)
- Written description
- Diagrams/scores
- Witness accounts

Purposes served:
- Proof of existence
- Instructions for recreation
- Historical record
- Sales material
- Critical evidence

Documentation paradoxes:
- Document ≠ work yet...
- Only access for most
- Shapes memory
- Becomes canonical
- Gains aura

Performance documentation:
- Staged for camera?
- Authentic record?
- Multiple angles
- Edit decisions
- Missing presence

Installation challenges:
- Scale lost
- Immersion flattened
- Sequence imposed
- Context stripped
- Experience reduced

Digital documentation:
- 360° capture
- VR recordings
- Live streaming
- Screen recordings
- Data logs

Market adaptations:
- Selling documentation
- Certificates of authenticity
- Recreation rights
- Archive values
- NFT verification

Philosophical questions:
- Which is "real"?
- Can documentation lie?
- Memory vs. record
- Experience vs. evidence
- Presence vs. trace

Best practices emerging:
- Multiple formats
- Process included
- Context preserved
- Participants credited
- Limits acknowledged

Documentation truth: Always partial, never neutral. Creates as much as records. The frame excludes. The edit interprets. Yet necessary bridge between event and history.
