# Memory Encoding

Experience → Brain change.

Levels of processing:
- Shallow: How does it look?
- Deep: What does it mean?

Deeper = Better memory.

Encoding specificity:
Best recall when context matches.
Learn underwater? Test underwater.

Elaboration helps:
- Connect to existing knowledge
- Generate examples
- Create stories

Memory begins with attention.
