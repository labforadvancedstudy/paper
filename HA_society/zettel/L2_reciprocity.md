# Reciprocity

## Core Insight
The social physics law: every action creates an obligation for reaction, binding society together through invisible debts.

Give someone a gift, they feel obligated to give back. Help a neighbor move, they'll help you later. Even a smile demands a smile in return. Reciprocity is social gravity - invisible but inescapable.

This isn't calculated tit-for-tat but felt obligation. The genius is in the imbalance - gifts can never be perfectly reciprocated, so we're always slightly in debt or credit to others. These imbalances create social bonds stronger than any contract.

Cultures that emphasize reciprocity (gift economies, favor networks) create dense social webs. Those that monetize everything (exact change, no obligations) create efficiency but lose connection.
