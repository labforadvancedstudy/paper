# Phonology
## Core Insight
The sound system of language - not just what sounds exist, but how they pattern and interact.

## The Sound Rules

Phonology is phonemes + rules. Every language has illegal sound combinations.

**English Phonotactics**:
- Can start with "str-" (street)
- Can't start with "tl-" (*tleet)
- Can end with "-ngth" (strength)
- Can't start with "ng-" (*ngeet)

**Phonological Processes**:
1. **Assimilation**: impossible → impossible (n→m before p)
2. **Deletion**: probably → prob'ly
3. **Insertion**: athlete → athalete
4. **Metathesis**: ask → aks
5. **Vowel harmony**: Turkish - all vowels match

**Syllable Structure**:
Different languages allow different complexities:
- Japanese: (C)V(N) - simple
- English: CCCVCCCC - complex (strengths)
- Hawaiian: (C)V - very simple

**Prosody** (Beyond segments):
- **Stress**: CONtent (noun) vs conTENT (adjective)
- **Tone**: Mandarin mā (mother) vs mǎ (horse)
- **Intonation**: "Really?" ↗ vs "Really." ↘

**Features**:
Sounds defined by features:
- [+voice]: b, d, g vs [-voice]: p, t, k
- [+nasal]: m, n vs [-nasal]: b, d
