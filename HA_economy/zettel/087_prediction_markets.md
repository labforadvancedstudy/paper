# Prediction Markets

## Core Insight
Prediction markets are humanity's attempt to price the future - turning uncertainty into tradeable assets and aggregating scattered knowledge into probability estimates.

The idea is elegant: create markets for future events. Will candidate X win? Trade shares that pay $1 if yes, $0 if no. The price becomes the probability. If shares trade at $0.65, the market thinks there's a 65% chance. Skin in the game ensures honesty - wrong predictions lose money.

These markets often outperform experts. Iowa Electronic Markets beat polls in predicting elections. Internal corporate prediction markets forecast project delays better than managers. Why? Markets aggregate information from everyone, weight confidence by bet size, and update continuously.

But prediction markets reveal something deeper: the future is a commodity. We're literally trading tomorrow. Each trade is a belief about reality crystallized into action. The market becomes a collective crystal ball, cloudy but better than individual guesses.

The limitations are revealing too. Prediction markets work for discrete, verifiable events. They struggle with long-term, complex, or manipulable outcomes. They can create self-fulfilling or self-defeating prophecies. If everyone believes the market, does that make it true or false?

Most intriguingly: if perfect prediction markets existed for everything, would free will disappear? Are we discovering the future or creating it through our collective bets?
