# Authority

## Core Insight
Authority is power that people accept as rightful - power dressed in the clothes of legitimacy.

While power can be naked force, authority comes wrapped in justification. "Do this because I can hurt you" is power. "Do this because it's right that I tell you" is authority.

Authority performs a magic trick: it transforms obedience from submission into duty. Under authority, compliance feels proper, even moral. This is why people follow laws even when no police are watching.

The sources of authority shift across time and culture:
- Traditional: "It's always been this way"
- Charismatic: "This person is extraordinary"
- Legal-rational: "The rules say so"
- Expert: "They know better"
- Democratic: "We chose this"

But authority is fragile. The moment people stop believing in its rightfulness, authority collapses back into mere power, requiring force to maintain.
