# Levels

## Core Insight
Reality comes in layers - discrete stages of organization where quantity becomes quality and new rules apply.

A level isn't just "more" or "less" - it's fundamentally different. Water molecules aren't "less wet" than oceans; they're not wet at all. Neurons aren't "less conscious" than brains; consciousness doesn't exist at that level. Levels are discontinuous jumps, not smooth gradients.

Each level has its own vocabulary, laws, and phenomena. Chemistry can't explain love. Physics can't explain economics. Not because they're wrong, but because they're at the wrong level. It's like trying to understand a novel by analyzing ink molecules.

Levels emerge from quantity but create quality. Enough atoms make molecules. Enough molecules make cells. Enough cells make minds. At each transition, genuinely new properties appear - not hidden in the parts but created by their interaction.

The key insight: you can fully understand one level without understanding others. A biologist needn't know quantum mechanics. A psychologist needn't know neuroscience. Each level is complete in itself while being part of a larger hierarchy.
