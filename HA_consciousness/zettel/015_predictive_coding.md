# 015 Predictive Coding - Anticipation

The brain as prediction machine. Consciousness might be
the feeling of prediction error.

## Core Principle
Brain maintains generative model of world:
- Top-down predictions flow downward
- Bottom-up errors flow upward
- Update model to minimize surprise

## Evidence
- Sensory cortex: More feedback than feedforward connections
- Attention: Amplifies prediction errors
- Illusions: When predictions override input
- Dreams: Predictions without input

## Hierarchical Processing
Each level predicts the level below:
- High levels: Abstract concepts
- Low levels: Sensory details
- Errors propagate up when predictions fail

## Consciousness Connection
Maybe consciousness = high-level prediction errors that
demand model updates. The "aha!" of mismatch.

We don't see reality - we see our predictions, corrected by error.
