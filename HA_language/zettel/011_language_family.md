# Language Family

## Core Insight
Languages have relatives - shared ancestry creates family trees of tongues.

## The Great Diaspora

Like species, languages evolve from common ancestors. The Indo-European discovery: Sanskrit, Greek, Latin share systematic similarities. They're cousins!

Major families:
- **Indo-European**: 3 billion speakers (English, Spanish, Hindi, Russian)
- **Sino-Tibetan**: 1.4 billion (Mandarin, Cantonese, Tibetan)
- **Niger-Congo**: 500 million (Swahili, Yoruba, Zulu)
- **Austronesian**: 380 million (Indonesian, Tagalog, Hawaiian)
- **Afroasiatic**: 370 million (Arabic, Hebrew, Amharic)
- **Dravidian**: 250 million (Tamil, Telugu)

The pattern: One language splits into dialects, dialects become languages, repeat for millennia.

Reconstruction: We can partially recreate dead ancestors. Proto-Indo-European had words for wheel, horse, snow - telling us when/where they lived.

Some languages are isolates - no known relatives. Basque, Korean(?), Japanese(?).
