# Contracts

## Core Insight
A contract is frozen trust - turning promises into enforceable reality through shared belief in future consequences.

Imagine two people making a deal. Without a contract, it's just words in the wind. With a contract, those words become a kind of magic spell that binds future behavior. Not through mystical forces, but through the collective agreement that breaking contracts has consequences.

The fascinating part? A contract is just marks on paper (or pixels on screens). It has no physical power. Yet it can compel billionaires to pay millions, force companies to deliver goods across oceans, and make strangers trust each other with their life savings.

This works because contracts create a shared fictional future that we all agree to make real. When you sign a lease, you're not just agreeing to pay rent - you're participating in a vast social technology that makes complex cooperation possible.

Without contracts, we'd be limited to immediate exchanges with people we personally trust. With them, strangers can cooperate across time and space, building everything from skyscrapers to global supply chains.
