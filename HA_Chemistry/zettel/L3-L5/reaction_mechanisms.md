# Reaction Mechanisms

## Core Insight
Chemical reactions are molecular choreography - precise sequences of bond breaking and forming, with transition states as the dance moves.

Reactions aren't instantaneous magic. They're step-by-step processes. Molecules collide, bonds stretch, electrons shift, new bonds form, old bonds break. Each step has its own energy barrier, its own geometry, its own rate.

Consider SN2 reactions: the attacking molecule approaches from behind, gradually forming a new bond as the leaving group's bond weakens. At the transition state, both bonds are partial. The molecule is neither reactant nor product - it's caught mid-transformation.

Rate-determining steps bottleneck reactions like narrow bridges on highways. Catalysts provide alternate routes with lower barriers. Understanding mechanisms lets us control reactions, design better pathways, predict products.
