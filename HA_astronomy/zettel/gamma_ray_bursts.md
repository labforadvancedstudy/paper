# Gamma Ray Bursts

## Core Insight
The universe's most powerful explosions flash randomly across the sky - releasing more energy in seconds than the Sun will in its lifetime, visible across the observable universe.

Cold War satellites watching for nuclear tests discovered cosmic gamma ray bursts (GRBs) in 1967. These brief flashes of gamma rays came from random sky directions, lasting milliseconds to minutes. Their origin remained mysterious for decades. Were they nearby neutron star flakes or distant cosmic catastrophes?

The answer came in 1997 when BeppoSAX caught a GRB's fading afterglow, enabling distance measurement. GRBs were cosmological - billions of light-years away. To be visible at such distances, they must be unimaginably powerful. Long GRBs (>2 seconds) come from massive star collapse - hypernovae creating black holes. Short GRBs (<2 seconds) come from neutron star mergers. Both beam energy in jets; we see GRBs when jets point at Earth. The energy release could sterilize planets across galaxies. GRBs may have caused mass extinctions on Earth. These random cosmic death rays remind us the universe is beautiful but violent.
