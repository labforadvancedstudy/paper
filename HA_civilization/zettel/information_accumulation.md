# Information Accumulation

## Core Insight
Civilization is a ratchet that only turns one way - information accumulates but rarely disappears.

Animals learn and die with their knowledge. Humans learn and add their knowledge to the pile. Each generation starts higher than the last. A modern child knows things that would astonish Newton.

This accumulation accelerates exponentially. More knowledge enables faster knowledge creation. Writing enabled libraries. Printing enabled mass education. Internet enabled instant global information sharing. Each leap multiplies the next.

But information accumulation has a dark side: complexity explosion. No one can know everything anymore. We're building a tower of knowledge so tall that no one can see the top, and the foundation is fracturing from the weight.
