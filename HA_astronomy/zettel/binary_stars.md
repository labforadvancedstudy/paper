# Binary Stars

## Core Insight
Most stars aren't alone - they dance in pairs or groups, orbiting common centers of mass, revealing stellar masses and creating cosmic laboratories for extreme physics.

Over half of stars visible as single points are actually multiple systems. Binary stars orbit their mutual center of mass, locked in gravitational embrace. Visual binaries show orbital motion over years. Spectroscopic binaries reveal themselves through Doppler-shifted spectral lines. Eclipsing binaries dim periodically as stars pass in front of each other.

Binaries gave astronomy a crucial tool: stellar mass measurement. Applying Kepler's laws to binary orbits yields masses - the fundamental parameter determining stellar evolution. Close binaries create exotic phenomena. Mass transfer from one star to another creates accretion disks, X-ray emission, and novae. Type Ia supernovae - our cosmic standard candles - occur when white dwarfs in binaries accrete past critical mass. Neutron star binaries spiraling together create gravitational waves and gamma-ray bursts. Binary pulsars test general relativity to exquisite precision. What seems like stellar companionship enables breakthrough science. The universe prefers pairs to singles.
