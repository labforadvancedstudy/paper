# Hierarchical Abstraction Research Collection

## Overview
This collection presents research on AI model capabilities through the lens of Hierarchical Abstraction (HA), organized into two versions based on scope and claims.

## Directory Structure

### v1/ - Technical Framework (For Publication)
Pure technical contributions on AI model scaling and knowledge transfer:
- Model size determines abstraction capacity
- Knowledge distillation should transfer high-level patterns
- Emergence explained by abstraction thresholds
- **No consciousness claims**
- **Ready for academic submission**

### v2/ - Extended Theory (Internal Research)
Philosophical extensions including consciousness and biological parallels:
- Consciousness as L9 self-reference
- Brain-AI unified model
- Universal organizing principles
- **Speculative content**
- **Not for immediate publication**

## Quick Navigation

### For Reviewers/Industry
→ Go to `v1/` for actionable technical framework

### For Deep Thinkers
→ Start with `v1/`, then explore `v2/` for philosophical implications

### For Implementation
→ `v1/` contains all practical guidelines

## Core Insight
**AI model parameters determine hierarchical abstraction capacity, not memorization quantity. This explains scaling, emergence, and enables efficient knowledge transfer.**

## Author Notes
- v1 represents solid technical contributions ready for peer review
- v2 contains exciting but unproven extensions worth exploring
- Both versions stem from the same core insight about hierarchical organization
