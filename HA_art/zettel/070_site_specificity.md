# Site Specificity

## Core Insight
Place as co-creator - where location becomes integral to meaning, work exists only in relation to context, and moving equals destroying.

Site-specific types:
- Physical (architectural response)
- Institutional (museum critique)
- Discursive (idea networks)
- Community (social fabric)
- Virtual (digital locations)

Pioneering works:
- Smithson's Spiral Jetty
- Serra's Tilted Arc
- Asher's wall removal
- Haacke's polls
- Wilson's Mining the Museum

Site reading required:
- History embedded
- Politics present
- Architecture speaking
- Community voiced
- Memory activated

Creation process:
- Site research deep
- Community consultation
- Formal response
- Integration attempted
- Activation planned

Challenges multiply:
- Temporary vs. permanent
- Documentation limits
- Community changes
- Maintenance needs
- Ownership questions

Contemporary expansions:
- URLs as sites
- Social media specific
- AR anchored
- Data localizations
- Platform specifics

Philosophical questions:
- Can sites move?
- Does documentation destroy?
- Who defines site?
- Virtual = real?
- Everywhere = nowhere?

Market accommodations:
- Certificates sold
- Recreations authorized
- Adaptations permitted
- Sites commodified
- Experience packaged

Core tension: Site-specificity resists art's mobility, challenges commodity status. Yet even earthworks become Instagram destinations. Place becomes brand. Resistance absorbed.
