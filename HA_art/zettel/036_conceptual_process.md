# Conceptual Process

## Core Insight
Idea as artwork - where thinking becomes form and documentation of process replaces precious object, proving that art lives in minds, not just materials.

Conceptual art's radical claim: idea is the work. Execution merely illustration. This reverses centuries of craft supremacy:
- Sol LeWitt: instructions for others
- Lawrence Weiner: descriptions sufficient
- John Baldessari: "I will not make boring art"
- Joseph Kosuth: definitions as art
- Yoko Ono: imagination instructions

Process reveals thinking:
- Sketches more interesting than paintings
- Failures included with successes
- Dead ends documented
- Iterations shown
- Thinking made visible

Documentation paradox:
- Document isn't artwork but...
- Without document, work vanishes
- Certificate authenticates idea
- Photo proves performance
- Text describes action

Institutional challenges:
- What does museum collect?
- How to preserve ideas?
- Can concepts degrade?
- Who owns thoughts?
- How to sell philosophy?

Digital suits conceptual:
- Code is pure instruction
- Algorithms are processes
- Blockchain proves authenticity
- Internet distributes ideas
- AI questions authorship

Contemporary expansion:
- Research as art
- Conversation as medium
- Systems as sculpture
- Data as material
- Networks as canvas

Yet objects persist. Even conceptualists made things. Pure idea needs form to communicate. Mind requires matter to manifest. The dream of pure concept remains that - dream.
