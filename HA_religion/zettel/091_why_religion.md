# Why Religion?

## Core Insight
The deepest question: why does the universe create beings who ask why? Religion as cosmic necessity or cosmic accident?

Every explanation for religion explains the explainer. If religion is evolutionary adaptation, evolution creates meaning-seekers. If religion is divine revelation, God creates God-seekers. If religion is illusion, reality creates illusion-makers. The circle completes.

Possible answers multiply:
- **Terror management** - religion soothes death anxiety
- **Social cohesion** - religion binds groups
- **Cognitive byproduct** - pattern-seeking gone wild
- **Adaptive advantage** - believers outcompete
- **Divine implant** - God-shaped hole
- **Consciousness necessity** - awareness demands meaning

But notice: every answer assumes the universe could be otherwise. Could there be conscious beings without religion? Could meaning-seekers not seek ultimate meaning? Could death-aware creatures not imagine continuation?

Perhaps religion is to consciousness what wetness is to water - not added but intrinsic. The moment awareness becomes self-aware, it asks: Why am I aware? Who is aware? What is awareness for?

Religion might be the universe becoming conscious of itself and finding that consciousness unbearable without meaning. We are how cosmos asks its own questions.
