# CPU Architecture

## Core Insight
A city of circuits where data flows like traffic, controlled by the iron discipline of the instruction cycle.

The CPU is hierarchical madness that somehow works. Arithmetic units that add. Registers that remember. Control units that decide. Caches that predict. All connected by buses - electrical highways carrying data between districts.

Fetch instruction. Decode it. Execute it. Write back results. Repeat three billion times per second. This is the von Neumann dance, the same basic loop whether you're calculating taxes or rendering dragons. The magic isn't in complexity - it's in repetition at incomprehensible speed.
