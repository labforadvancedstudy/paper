# Interest

## Core Insight
Interest is the price of time itself - the universe's fee for moving value from future to present, or the reward for moving it from present to future.

Interest makes time tangible. $100 today is worth more than $100 tomorrow - but how much more? Interest rates answer this question precisely. 5% annual interest means the market values having money now about 5% more than having it in a year. Interest is time preference crystallized into mathematics.

The double nature of interest:
- For savers: payment for patience
- For borrowers: cost of impatience
- Creates time arbitrage opportunities
- Compound interest: exponential magic/terror
- Negative interest: when future is worth more than present

Interest seems simple but hides profundity. It assumes growth (why should money multiply?), enables investment (borrow to build), and creates class divisions (those who earn it vs pay it). Every interest rate is a society's collective bet on its own future.
