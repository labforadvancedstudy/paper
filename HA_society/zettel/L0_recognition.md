# Recognition

## Core Insight
The moment when one consciousness acknowledges another consciousness exists - the birth of the social.

A baby's first real smile at their mother. A dog's tail wagging when you come home. The nod between strangers passing on a trail. Recognition is the spark that jumps between minds, saying "I see you seeing me."

Without recognition, we're alone in our heads. With it, society begins. Every relationship, institution, and civilization starts with this: I recognize you as real, as mattering, as being like me but not me.
