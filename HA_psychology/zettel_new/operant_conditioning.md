# Operant Conditioning

Learning through consequences: behaviors followed by rewards increase, behaviors followed by punishments decrease. Skinner's blueprint for shaping behavior.

## The Skinner Box
Rat presses lever → Food appears → Lever pressing increases
The environment shapes behavior through systematic consequences.

## Types of Consequences
- **Positive reinforcement**: Add good thing (praise)
- **Negative reinforcement**: Remove bad thing (aspirin for headache)
- **Positive punishment**: Add bad thing (speeding ticket)
- **Negative punishment**: Remove good thing (losing privileges)

## Reinforcement Schedules
- Continuous: Every response rewarded
- Fixed ratio: Every nth response
- Variable ratio: Unpredictable (slot machines)
- Fixed interval: First response after time period
- Variable interval: Unpredictable timing

## Modern Applications
- App notifications (variable ratio)
- Employee bonuses
- Child behavior management
- Animal training
