# Feedback Loops

## Core Insight
Life's autopilot - circular causality that maintains stability without any controller.

A thermostat is a simple negative feedback loop: too hot → cooling on → temperature drops → cooling off. Your body runs thousands of these simultaneously. Blood sugar high? Release insulin. Temperature rising? Start sweating. pH shifting? Adjust breathing.

But biology adds positive feedback too - loops that amplify rather than dampen. Birth contractions trigger more contractions. Blood clotting triggers more clotting. Action potentials regenerate themselves down axons. These create rapid, decisive responses when needed.

The magic is in the interweaving. Multiple feedback loops interact, creating stability from instability. It's like juggling while riding a unicycle on a tightrope - each balance depends on the others.

No CEO runs your body. No central command coordinates the loops. They self-organize through evolution-tested interactions. Each loop "knows" only its local job, yet together they maintain the impossibly complex state called "alive."
