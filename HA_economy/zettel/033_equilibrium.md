# Equilibrium

## Core Insight
The market's balance point: where opposing forces create momentary stillness - economics' version of peace.

Equilibrium is where supply kisses demand, where price stops moving, where the market clears. It's the invisible target all markets aim for but never quite hit, like a pendulum seeking rest.

Equilibrium characteristics:
- **Balance** - quantity supplied equals quantity demanded
- **Clearing** - no shortages or surpluses
- **Stability** - forces push back toward balance
- **Temporary** - constantly disrupted and reformed
- **Multiple** - many possible balance points

Types of equilibrium:
- Partial (one market)
- General (all markets)
- Static (snapshot)
- Dynamic (moving balance)
- Stable vs unstable

The beautiful insight: no one plans equilibrium. Millions of selfish actors somehow create collective balance. The invisible hand is really invisible equilibrium-seeking.

Yet equilibrium is theoretical - markets never actually rest. They're always overshooting, undershooting, seeking a balance that keeps moving. Equilibrium is less a place than a direction.
