# Scarcity

## Core Insight
Economics exists because of one cruel fact: there isn't enough of what we want - the universe's harsh teaching.

Scarcity is economics' first principle. If everything were infinite, there would be no economics. Scarcity forces choice, creates value, drives innovation. It's the wound that civilization tries to heal.

Scarcity manifests as:
- **Physical limits** - finite oil, land, gold
- **Time limits** - only 24 hours per day
- **Attention limits** - can't focus on everything
- **Energy limits** - entropy always wins
- **Knowledge limits** - can't know everything

Scarcity creates:
- **Competition** - fighting for limited resources
- **Innovation** - finding ways around limits
- **Trade-offs** - choosing means not-choosing
- **Value** - scarcity makes things precious
- **Conflict** - wars over resources

The paradox: solving one scarcity often creates another. More food means more people means more food scarcity. Scarcity is hydra-headed.

Yet scarcity is also economics' engine. It drives all progress, all innovation, all human striving. Without scarcity, would we strive at all?
