# Group Living

## Core Insight
Humans survive not as individuals but as groups - the first and most fundamental pattern of civilization.

Watch any group of humans for an hour. They don't scatter like cats. They cluster, they coordinate, they create invisible boundaries of "us." This isn't learned - babies prefer faces, toddlers play together, children form packs. We're wired for groups like fish are wired for water.

The magic happens around 150 people - Dunbar's number. Below that, everyone knows everyone. Above that, you need new tricks: symbols, hierarchies, stories about why we're together. But it starts here: humans in the same space, not killing each other, maybe even helping.

Every civilization, from the first campfire circle to modern Tokyo, is built on this impossible fact: strangers can become "us."
