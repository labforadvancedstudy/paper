# Buying

## Core Insight
The magic moment: abstract symbols (money) become real things - humanity's greatest trick.

A child buying candy with their first dollar bill experiences pure economic sorcery. Paper becomes chocolate. Numbers become toys. The abstract becomes concrete. This is the moment economics transcends barter.

Buying teaches:
- **Money is universal desire** - it becomes anything
- **Choice is finite** - buying this means not-buying that
- **Prices communicate** - how much others want it
- **Regret is real** - buyer's remorse at age 5
- **Money vanishes** - spent is gone

The child-buyer discovers:
- The agony of choice (candy OR toy?)
- The joy of possession (it's MINE now)
- The puzzle of value (why does this cost more?)
- The pain of not-enough (short by 50 cents)
- The power of earning (I need more money!)

Every purchase, from penny candy to corporate acquisitions, is this same magic: stored human effort transforms into desired objects. The child with coins at the corner store is performing the fundamental economic ritual.

Buying is voting with life force. Every purchase says "this matters to me."
