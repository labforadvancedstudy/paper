# Product in Hand

## Core Insight
The product is the company's thought made material - where organizational intention crystallizes into something a human can hold, use, experience.

Before profit, before brand, before scale - there is the thing itself. The product in hand is proof of company's purpose. It's collective effort condensed into form. Every product carries the ghost of every meeting, decision, revision that birthed it.

Holding your company's product differently than consuming another's. It's your child, your output, your impact made tangible. The flaws hurt more. The successes glow brighter. You see not object but process - remembering who fought for that feature, who solved that problem.

Products are how companies touch the world. Through products, organizational intelligence becomes distributed intelligence. Each unit carries company DNA into the wild, replicating value, spreading influence, creating connection between maker and user.
