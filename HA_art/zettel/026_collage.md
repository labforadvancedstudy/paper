# Collage

## Core Insight
Reality remixed - where fragments of existing world reassemble into new meanings, proving that context creates content and juxtaposition generates revelation.

Collage began as revolution. Picasso's "Still Life with Chair Caning" (1912) glued actual oilcloth to canvas. Suddenly, real objects entered art space. Boundaries dissolved. Everything became potential material.

Collage techniques multiply:
- Papier collé: paper on paper beginnings
- Photomontage: images spliced, reality questioned
- Assemblage: 3D collage, objects combined
- Digital collage: endless source, perfect cuts
- Mixed media: collage principle across materials

Power lies in juxtaposition:
- Disparate sources create third meaning
- Context shifts transform content
- Scale relationships disturb logic
- Time periods collapse together
- High/low culture boundaries dissolve

Dadaists weaponized collage. Hannah Höch's photomontages sliced gender/politics. Max Ernst's novels without words. They understood: cutting equals criticism. Reassembly challenges reality's construction.

Digital exploded collage potential:
- Infinite source material online
- Perfect selection tools
- Layers without physical limit
- Undo encourages experimentation
- But loses tactile quality, paper edges

Contemporary collage everywhere:
- Sampling in music
- Memes as cultural collage
- Fashion's reference mixing
- Architecture's quotation
- Code's copy-paste culture

Yet scissors and glue persist. Why? Physical collage preserves source materials' aura. Torn edges tell truth. Glue bumps add dimension. Hand-cut reveals process. Accidents create discoveries.
