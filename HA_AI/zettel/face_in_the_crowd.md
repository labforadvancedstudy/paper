# Face in the Crowd

## Core Insight
Your phone unlocks by looking at you - a miracle of recognition we now consider mundane, forgetting it solves a problem evolution took millions of years to perfect.

A glance and click. The device knows YOU, not your identical twin, not a photo, not a mask. It maps the unique geography of your face - the distance between eyes, the curve of cheekbones, the pattern that is undeniably you. What once required human consciousness now happens in milliseconds on a chip.

But the uncanny moment comes when it fails. You're wearing sunglasses, or lying at an odd angle, and suddenly you remember - a machine is trying to recognize you. In that failure, the magic becomes visible. A complex dance of light, mathematics, and meaning, all to answer one question: is this you?
