# Dark Sky Problem

## Core Insight
Why is the night sky dark? This simple question, known as Olbers' paradox, contains profound cosmological truth - the universe must be finite in age or size, or both.

If the universe were infinite, eternal, and uniformly filled with stars, every line of sight would eventually hit a star's surface. The entire sky should blaze as bright as the Sun. Yet night is dark. This paradox, articulated by Heinrich Olbers in 1823, seemed trivial but proved fundamental.

The resolution requires modern cosmology. The universe has finite age (~13.8 billion years), so light from distant stars hasn't reached us. Expansion redshifts distant light beyond visibility. Stars have finite lifetimes. The paradox's solution implies the universe had a beginning and evolves. A child's question - "Why is it dark at night?" - contains the Big Bang. Sometimes the most profound mysteries hide in plain sight. The darkness between stars tells us more about the universe than the stars themselves.
