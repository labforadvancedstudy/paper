# Emergence

## Core Insight
More is different - when quantity becomes quality.

## The Magic of Thresholds

One water molecule isn't wet. A billion are. One neuron isn't conscious. 86 billion are. Where does wetness begin? Where does mind emerge?

L1: Lots make different
L2: Divine sparks unite
L3: Whole exceeds parts
L4: Novel properties arise
L5: System-level features
L6: Strong/weak emergence
L7: Complexity unfolds
L8: Phase transitions
L9: All is emergence

The mystery: emergent properties seem genuinely new. Not just hidden in parts but created by combination. How?
