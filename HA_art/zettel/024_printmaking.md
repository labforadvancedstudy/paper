# Printmaking

## Core Insight
The democratic multiple - where mechanical reproduction creates originals, each impression a birth from matrix, spreading images like seeds on wind.

Printmaking reverses thinking. Work backwards from result:
- Relief: raised surface prints (woodcut, linocut)
- Intaglio: incised lines hold ink (etching, engraving)
- Planographic: flat surface chemistry (lithography)
- Stencil: pushing through openings (screenprint)
- Digital: matrix made of code, not matter

Each technique brings character:
- Woodcut: bold, graphic, grain visible
- Etching: delicate lines, atmospheric effects
- Lithography: drawing-like, tonal ranges
- Screenprint: flat color, sharp edges
- Monotype: unique despite print process

The multiple challenges art market's rarity worship. Yet editions create accessibility. Democratic ideal: art for many, not few. Though irony emerges - small editions, high prices, artificial scarcity reimposed.

Process fascinates. Backwards writing for text. Mirror-thinking constant. Happy accidents from registration errors. The press moment - reveal anxiety. Matrix holds potential; print realizes it.

Contemporary printmaking embraces hybrid:
- Photo-processes meet hand-drawing
- Laser-cutting meets traditional carving
- 3D printing questions "print" definition
- NFTs create digital "editions"
- Instagram as print distribution

But physical print persists. The paper matters. The ink sits on surface, not in screen. Light reflects, doesn't emit. Touch reveals texture. Even digital artists make physical prints - why? Presence.
