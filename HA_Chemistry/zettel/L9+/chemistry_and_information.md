# Chemistry and Information

## Core Insight
Chemistry is information processing - molecules store data, reactions compute, DNA programs, proteins execute.

DNA stores information at 2 bits per base pair - quaternary code more efficient than binary. But it's not just storage. DNA replication is copying, transcription is compilation, translation is execution. The cell is a chemical computer.

Molecular recognition is pattern matching. Enzymes are IF-THEN statements: IF substrate fits active site, THEN catalyze reaction. Allosteric regulation implements feedback loops. Signal transduction cascades are amplification circuits.

Information theory meets thermodynamics in Maxwell's demon paradox. Creating order requires information, information processing requires energy. The cell pays in ATP to maintain its informational order against entropy. Life is a local reversal of the second law, powered by information processing.
