# Radiation

## Core Insight
Invisible bullets traveling at light speed - the cosmic rain that breaks electronics, damages DNA, and reminds us that space wants everything dead, constantly, enthusiastically.

Space radiation isn't like getting an X-ray. It's a continuous assault of high-energy particles that Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere shield us from. In space, you're naked to the universe's violence.

The radiation zoo:
- Solar wind: Continuous proton/electron stream
- Solar flares: Sudden particle storms
- Cosmic rays: Galactic bullets (highest energy)
- Van Allen belts: Earth's trapped radiation
- Secondary radiation: Primary particles hitting spacecraft

What radiation breaks:
- Electronics (bit flips, latch-up, total failure)
- Solar panels (efficiency degradation)
- Human DNA (cancer, cataracts, sterility)
- Materials (brittleness, discoloration)
- Sensors (noise, calibration drift)

Protection strategies reveal the challenge:
- Shielding: Mass = protection = launch cost
- Redundancy: Multiple systems, voting logic
- Rad-hard parts: Expensive, outdated technology
- Operational: Orient spacecraft, shelter crews
- Pharmaceutical: Drugs to repair damage

The cruel math:
- Mars trip: ~1 Sievert (1% cancer risk per trip)
- Solar storm: Potentially lethal without shelter
- Jupiter vicinity: Electronics die in minutes
- Galactic cosmic rays: No practical shielding

Radiation shapes everything:
- Orbit selection (avoiding Van Allen belts)
- Mission duration (exposure limits)
- Electronic design (rad-tolerant architectures)
- Human missions (the showstopper problem)

In space, radiation is the tax you pay for leaving Earth's protective bubble. It never stops. It only accumulates.
