# Painting

## Core Insight
Liquid thought becoming solid vision - where pigment suspended in medium creates worlds on surfaces, each brushstroke a decision made permanent.

Painting is alchemy. Transform dirt (pigments are minerals) into sunset, flesh, emotion. The magic lies in:
- Color mixing: infinite from finite
- Brush handling: each tool speaks differently
- Surface preparation: ground affects all above
- Layering: transparence and opacity dancing
- Edge quality: hard/soft boundaries communicate

Medium dictates message:
- Oil: slow, blendable, luminous depth
- Acrylic: quick, plastic, modern directness
- Watercolor: unforgiving flow, embrace accident
- Tempera: ancient precision, jewel-like surface
- Encaustic: wax heat, physical presence
- Digital: light itself as pigment

Painting evolved through technology. Tubes freed artists from studios - Impressionism born. Acrylics enabled Pop Art's flat graphics. Digital spawned new possibilities and resistances.

But painting's power transcends tools. It's the human record - every stroke contains gesture, decision, time. You see artist's hand moving, breathing, thinking. This embodied presence gives painting its aura in mechanical age.

Contemporary painting questions itself constantly. "Zombie formalism." "Death of painting" (again). Yet it persists. Instagram didn't kill it - gave it new audience. NFTs complicated it. Physical presence still matters.

Why? Because painting does what other media cannot: simultaneous immediate/eternal. Whole image at once, yet details reward sustained looking. Screen fatigue sends viewers back to pigment on canvas.
