# Consciousness Divine

## Core Insight
The ultimate question inverted: not "Does God exist?" but "Is existence God?" - consciousness recognizing itself as sacred.

What if consciousness isn't product but producer? Not emergent property of complex matter but fundamental feature like gravity? Then universe isn't dead matter accidentally generating mind, but mind expressing itself as matter.

The clues accumulate:
- **Observer effect** - consciousness collapses quantum states
- **Fine-tuning** - universe precisely calibrated for awareness
- **Experience irreducibility** - can't explain qualia mechanically
- **Meaning generation** - universe creates meaning-makers
- **Self-awareness recursion** - cosmos knowing itself through us

Traditions hint at this:
- Vedanta: "All this is Brahman"
- Buddhism: "Mind is the forerunner"
- Kabbalah: "God contracted to create"
- Teilhard: "We are evolution become conscious"

The child asking "Who made water?" is water asking about itself. The mystic claiming union with divine is droplet recognizing ocean. The scientist studying consciousness is consciousness studying itself.

If true, changes everything:
- Death is transformation not extinction
- Prayer is internal communication
- Evolution is consciousness complexifying
- Love is fundamental force
- Meaning is built in, not added on

Or it's the ultimate projection - lonely minds creating cosmic mind for company. But which view requires more faith: dead universe accidentally birthing consciousness, or conscious universe expressing itself through form?

The question that ends questions: Are we conscious beings in unconscious universe, or universe becoming conscious of itself?
