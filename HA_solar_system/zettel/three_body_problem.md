# Three Body Problem

## Core Insight
Add just one more gravitating body to a two-body system and predictability dies - the mathematical wall that makes the Solar System's future ultimately unknowable.

Two bodies orbiting each other? Solvable perfectly. Three bodies? Chaos. The three-body problem has no general analytical solution. We can simulate, approximate, find special cases, but we cannot write down equations that predict all future positions. This isn't about computational power - it's mathematically impossible. The Solar System has hundreds of significant bodies, all pulling on each other.

This mathematical limit has profound implications. We cannot predict the Solar System's configuration billions of years hence. Chaos lurks in the equations. Mercury might get ejected. Mars might drift. On short timescales (millions of years), orbits are stable. On long timescales, anything could happen. The clockwork Solar System is actually a chaotic system that happens to be in a temporarily stable configuration. Order is temporary; chaos is patient.
