# Prayer

## Core Insight
The impossible conversation - speaking into silence and sometimes hearing answer.

Watch a child talk to the dark. "Please make the bad dreams go away." No theology here, just raw need reaching beyond itself. Prayer is the most audacious human act: assuming the universe listens.

Prayer at its core:
- Words or wordlessness directed "up" or "out" or "in"
- Assumption that Someone/Something receives
- Hope that reality can be influenced by asking
- Relationship attempted across impossible distance
- Vulnerability made vocal

The varieties are endless but the impulse singular: we are not alone, and the Not-Alone might care. Whether gratitude, petition, confession, or praise - prayer assumes connection where none is visible.

Even atheists pray in extremity. The "no atheists in foxholes" isn't about cowardice but about prayer being more fundamental than belief. The cry goes out before the mind decides who might hear it.

Prayer is how the finite calls to the infinite, usually getting silence, sometimes getting everything.
