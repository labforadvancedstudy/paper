# Conceptual Art

## Core Insight
The dematerialization of the art object - where idea becomes primary and execution secondary, challenging every assumption about what art is, who makes it, and how it exists.

Core principles:
- Idea is the art
- Execution mechanical
- Language central
- Documentation sufficient
- Object unnecessary

Key practitioners/works:
- Weiner: statements as sculpture
- Kosuth: definitions presented
- LeWitt: instructions for others
- Kawara: date paintings
- Barry: invisible art

Strategies developed:
- Instructions (anyone can execute)
- Documentation (photo proves idea)
- Systems (rules generate work)
- Language (words as material)
- Absence (nothing as something)

Philosophical roots:
- Duchamp's readymades
- Wittgenstein's language games
- Minimalism's reduction
- Fluxus scores
- Information theory

Institutional challenges:
- What to collect?
- How to preserve?
- Where to store?
- Who owns ideas?
- Can concepts degrade?

Market adaptations:
- Certificates sold
- Instructions commodified
- Documentation valued
- Estates control
- Scarcity manufactured

Contemporary conceptualism:
- Post-internet art
- Blockchain concepts
- AI procedures
- Data as medium
- Networks as form

Criticisms persist:
- Intellectualism
- Elitism
- Coldness
- Masculinity
- Western bias

Yet influence total: All contemporary art conceptual to degree. Ideas matter. Context creates. Concept consciousness permanent.
