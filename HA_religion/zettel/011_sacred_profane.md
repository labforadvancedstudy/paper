# Sacred and Profane

## Core Insight
The first religious distinction: some things are set apart, charged with otherness, not to be treated as ordinary.

Before any specific belief comes this division of reality. The sacred is what makes you take off your shoes, lower your voice, feel the weight of significance. The profane is everything else - the daily, the ordinary, the touchable without consequence.

The boundary manifests everywhere:
- Sacred space (temple) vs profane space (market)
- Sacred time (Sabbath) vs profane time (workday)
- Sacred objects (altar) vs profane objects (table)
- Sacred people (priests) vs profane people (everyone else)
- Sacred words (prayers) vs profane words (conversation)

But the boundary is permeable. Consecration moves things from profane to sacred. Desecration moves them back. The same water becomes holy when blessed, ordinary when spilled.

The sacred inspires both attraction and fear - mysterium tremendum et fascinans. We're drawn to it and terrified by it. Too close and you burn. Too far and you starve.

Every religion is a system for managing the sacred/profane boundary. How to approach safely. When to withdraw. What requires mediation. Where the holy hides in the everyday.
