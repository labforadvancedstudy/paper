# Friendship

## Core Insight
The first chosen bond - proof that humans connect beyond biological necessity or economic benefit.

Unlike family (you're born into) or colleagues (you work with), friends are pure choice. Two kids deciding to build a fort together, teenagers sharing secrets, adults meeting for coffee - friendship is society saying "utility isn't everything."

Aristotle identified three types: utility (useful to each other), pleasure (fun together), and virtue (good for each other's character). But kids know simpler truth: a friend is someone who plays with you and doesn't leave when you cry.

Friendship scales differently than family - you can have many friends but only one mother. This abundance model teaches us that love isn't zero-sum.
