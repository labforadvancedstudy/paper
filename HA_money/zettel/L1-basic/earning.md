# Earning

## Core Insight
Earning money is the fundamental exchange of human time, energy, and capability for society's universal token of value - we sell pieces of our finite lives for tokens of potential.

When you earn money, you're not just receiving payment - you're converting your irreplaceable hours into storable, transferable power. Every paycheck represents crystalized time, frozen effort, packaged potential. This is why losing money hurts: it's not just numbers, it's your life's energy evaporating.

The psychology of earning:
- First paycheck: the ritual of adulthood
- Regular salary: security but also chains
- Unexpected bonus: joy disproportionate to amount
- Earned vs given: profound difference in feeling
- The pride/burden of being a "breadwinner"

Earning creates our deepest relationship with money. Money we earn feels different from money we find or receive. It carries the weight of our effort, the memory of our labor. This is why "easy money" feels wrong - it breaks the fundamental equation of effort = reward.
