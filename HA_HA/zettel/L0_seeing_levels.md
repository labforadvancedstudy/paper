# Seeing Levels

## Core Insight
That moment when you suddenly see the layers - like switching from 2D to 3D vision, revealing depth that was always there but invisible.

Everyone has experienced it. Reading a simple story as a child, then rereading as an adult and seeing layers of meaning. Looking at a tree and seeing wood, then cells, then chemistry, then quantum dance. The same reality, different levels of seeing.

It often happens suddenly. You're stuck at one level of understanding, then *click* - a new level opens. What seemed complete reveals itself as partial. What seemed complex becomes simple when viewed from above. What seemed simple shows infinite depth when you zoom in.

The experience is visceral. Your mind feels like it's expanding, creating new space for understanding. Old knowledge doesn't disappear but gets recontextualized. You don't lose the lower level; you gain perspective on it.

Once you see levels, you can't unsee them. Every subject reveals its hierarchy. Every explanation has its abstraction level. You become conscious of your own level-shifting, able to zoom in and out deliberately. Vision becomes navigation.
