# DNA

## Core Insight
A molecule that contains instructions for building the machine that reads the molecule - the universe's most elegant recursive loop.

DNA is a chemical that knows how to make copies of itself, but only by convincing other chemicals to do the work. It's like a book that contains instructions for building a library, librarians, and more books.

Four letters - A, T, G, C. That's it. Every organism on Earth, from bacteria to blue whales, is written in this four-letter alphabet. Shakespeare used 26 letters to write Hamlet. Life uses 4 to write everything that has ever lived.

But DNA is helpless alone. It can't replicate itself, can't build anything, can't even leave the nucleus. It's pure information, requiring an entire cellular machinery to express its meaning. The machinery is built from instructions in the DNA. Circular dependency at its finest.

The real magic: errors. DNA copying isn't perfect, and thank goodness. Each mistake is a experiment. Most fail, some do nothing, a few improve things. These errors, accumulated over billions of years, wrote the instructions for every living thing. Mistakes aren't bugs - they're features.
