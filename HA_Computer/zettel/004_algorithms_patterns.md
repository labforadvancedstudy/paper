# Algorithms as Patterns
## Core Insight
Algorithms aren't just computer procedures - they're patterns of transformation found throughout nature and mind.

## What Makes an Algorithm

Essential properties:
- **Finite**: Must end
- **Definite**: Each step clear
- **Input**: Takes information
- **Output**: Produces result
- **Effective**: Actually doable

But deeper: Algorithms are crystallized problem-solving.

## Natural Algorithms

**Evolution**: Genetic algorithm
- Selection
- Mutation  
- Reproduction
- Iteration

**River Formation**: Gradient descent
- Find steepest path
- Erode channel
- Optimize flow

**Ant Colonies**: Distributed search
- Explore randomly
- Mark successful paths
- Converge on optimal

**Brain Learning**: Backpropagation
- Try connection
- Measure error
- Adjust weights

## Algorithm Classes

**Search**: Finding in space
**Sort**: Ordering by criteria
**Optimize**: Finding best
**Transform**: Changing form
**Generate**: Creating new

Each class reflects deep pattern in reality.

## The Recursive Beauty

Algorithms can:
- Analyze algorithms
- Generate algorithms
- Optimize algorithms
- Prove things about algorithms

Meta-computation emerges.
