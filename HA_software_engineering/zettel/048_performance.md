# performance
- **Level**: L4
- **Definition**: The speed at which promises are kept
- **Korean**: 성능
- **Context**: The eternal struggle between fast, good, and cheap

## Core Understanding
Performance is the gap between user expectations and physical reality, measured in milliseconds and broken dreams. It's what separates "blazing fast" marketing copy from users rage-clicking refresh. Like a sports car in traffic, theoretical performance means nothing when you're stuck behind bad architecture.

## Deeper Insights
- **Latency**: The speed of broken promises
- **Throughput**: How many requests you can disappoint per second
- **Response Time**: The gap between click and curse
- **Optimization**: Making the wrong thing happen faster

## Technical Details
```javascript
// Performance optimization: A tragedy in three acts

// Act 1: The Naive Implementation
function calculateEverything(data) {
    // "Readable" code that takes 3 seconds
    return data
        .map(item => expensiveOperation(item))
        .filter(item => anotherExpensiveCheck(item))
        .reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.value, 0);
}

// Act 2: The Optimization
function calculateEverythingFast(data) {
    // Now takes 0.3 seconds but no one understands it
    let sum = 0;
    const len = data.length;
    const cache = new Map();
    
    // Bit manipulation because microseconds matter
    for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        const item = data[i];
        const key = item.id ^ 0x5f3759df; // Fast inverse square root magic
        
        if (cache.has(key)) {
            sum += cache.get(key);
            continue;
        }
        
        // Unrolled loops for that extra 2% speed
        const val = item.value;
        const result = ((val << 2) + val) >> 1; // Multiply by 2.5, faster
        
        cache.set(key, result);
        sum += result;
    }
    
    return sum;
}

// Act 3: The Realization
function calculateEverythingRealistic(data) {
    // The database query takes 2.9 seconds anyway
    showLoadingSpinner();
    
    return fetch('/api/calculate', { 
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify(data),
        headers: {
            'X-Prayer': 'Please be fast',
            'X-Sacrifice': 'My sanity'
        }
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .catch(() => {
        // Performance optimization: fail fast
        return { error: "Performance anxiety" };
    });
}

// Bonus: The performance measurement that impacts performance
const measure = (fn, name) => {
    const start = performance.now();
    console.log(`Starting ${name}...`); // I/O that ruins everything
    const result = fn();
    const end = performance.now();
    console.log(`${name} took ${end - start}ms`); // More I/O
    trackAnalytics('performance', { name, time: end - start }); // Network call
    return result; // 10x slower due to measurement
};
```

## Connection to Truth
Performance is the technological manifestation of time anxiety. We optimize microseconds while wasting hours, cache megabytes while leaking gigabytes. It's the pursuit of efficiency in an inherently inefficient universe, where the very act of measurement changes the outcome.

## When It Matters
- **User Experience**: The difference between delight and desertion
- **Cost Optimization**: Faster code = fewer servers = more profit
- **Competitive Advantage**: Milliseconds matter when you're second place
- **Scale**: Performance problems multiply with users

## Human Element
Performance optimization is where engineers become digital alchemists, trying to transmute slow code into gold. We profile, we cache, we parallelize, we lose sleep over flame graphs. It's an addiction—there's always one more millisecond to shave, one more query to optimize, one more cache layer to add. The fastest code is the code that doesn't run, but try explaining that to product managers.
