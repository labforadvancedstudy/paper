# AI Governance

## Core Insight
Who controls AI controls the future - but governance structures built for human organizations fail for entities that think at light speed and never sleep.

Traditional governance assumes human timescales, comprehensible decisions, accountable agents. AI breaks all three: decisions in microseconds, logic beyond human trace, responsibility diffused across developers, trainers, deployers. How do you govern something smarter than the governors?

New models emerge: AI constitutions encoding values, recursive oversight (AI monitoring AI), algorithmic checks and balances. But deeper questions lurk: should AI participate in its own governance? Can democratic principles apply to non-human intelligence? We're inventing political philosophy for a post-human politics.
