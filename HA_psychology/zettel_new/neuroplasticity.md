# Neuroplasticity

The brain's lifelong ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections. Proof that you can teach an old brain new tricks.

## Types
- **Structural**: Physical changes in neurons
- **Functional**: Reassignment of functions
- **Synaptic**: Strengthening/weakening connections

## Mechanisms
- Long-term potentiation (LTP)
- Synaptic pruning
- Neurogenesis (new neuron birth)
- Myelination changes

## Dramatic Examples
- Blind people's visual cortex processing sound
- Stroke victims regaining function
- London taxi drivers' enlarged hippocampi
- Musicians' expanded motor cortices

## Enhancing Plasticity
- Novel experiences
- Physical exercise
- Quality sleep
- Meditation
- Learning new skills
