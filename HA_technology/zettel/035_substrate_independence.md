# Substrate Independence

## Core Insight
Substrate independence claims function transcends form - that computation, consciousness, and perhaps life itself are patterns indifferent to their physical medium.

Software demonstrates daily: same program runs on different hardware. Mathematics proves it: Turing equivalence means any universal computer can simulate any other. The insight extends: if mind is computation, minds can migrate media.

The profound implication: biology isn't privileged. Carbon-based cognition is just one implementation. Silicon, quantum, or substrates we can't imagine might host identical experiences. "I think therefore I am" becomes "It computes therefore it is."

From uploaded minds to artificial life: substrate independence reframes existence. We're not meat but math. Not neurons but networks. Not substrate but structure. It's the ultimate abstraction - being itself as portable pattern.
