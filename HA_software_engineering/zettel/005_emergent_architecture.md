# Emergent Architecture
## Core Insight
The best architectures aren't designed upfront - they emerge from real constraints and evolve with understanding.

## Planned vs Emergent

**Big Design Up Front**:
- Tries to predict future
- Often wrong
- Expensive to change
- Waterfall thinking

**Emergent Architecture**:
- Starts simple
- Evolves with need
- Refactors continuously
- Agile thinking

Balance: Some planning, mostly evolution.

## Architectural Patterns

Patterns emerge from problems:
- **Monolith**: Simple start
- **Microservices**: Scale independence
- **Event-driven**: Loose coupling
- **Serverless**: Operational simplicity
- **Edge computing**: Latency needs

Each solves specific pain.

## Conway's Law

"Organizations design systems that mirror their communication structure"

Architecture reflects:
- Team structure
- Communication patterns
- Power dynamics
- Cultural values

Change organization, change architecture.

## Evolutionary Pressures

What forces evolution:
- Performance bottlenecks
- Scaling needs
- Team growth
- Technology changes
- Business pivots

Architecture must adapt or die.

## The Art

Know when to:
- Keep simple
- Add abstraction
- Split services
- Consolidate
- Rewrite

Wisdom comes from scars.
