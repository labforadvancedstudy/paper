# Technology Impact

## Core Insight
Tools reshaping consciousness - where each new technology doesn't just change how art is made but what art can be, fundamentally rewiring creative possibilities and human perception.

Technology cycles predictable:
- New tool appears
- Artists experiment
- Purists resist
- Integration happens
- Next disruption arrives

Major disruptions tracked:
- Photography: painting's "death"
- Film: time-based art
- Video: democratized moving image
- Computers: algorithmic creation
- Internet: networked consciousness
- AI: creativity questioned

Each technology brings:
- New aesthetics
- Different workflows
- Shifted power dynamics
- Access changes
- Preservation challenges

Current impacts visible:
- NFTs redefine ownership
- AI generates images
- VR creates spaces
- Blockchain authenticates
- Algorithms curate

Artist responses vary:
- Early adopters explore
- Traditionalists resist
- Hybrids emerge
- Critics theorize
- Markets adjust slowly

Unintended consequences:
- Skill definitions change
- Authenticity questions multiply
- Distribution democratizes/concentrates
- Preservation nightmares
- Digital divide widens

Future technologies loom:
- Quantum computing
- Brain-computer interfaces
- Synthetic biology
- Nano-materials
- Unknown unknowns

Central question: Does technology serve vision or create it? Tool worship vs. tool agnosticism. Balance between possibility and purpose needed.
