# Compilation

## Core Insight
Compilation is translation between worlds - from the fuzzy realm of human thought to the crystalline precision of machine execution.

A compiler is the most judgmental translator imaginable. It refuses to work with ambiguity, demands perfect grammar, and stops at the first mistake. Yet this strictness is a gift - it catches our sloppy thinking before it can cause runtime disasters.

The compilation process is a journey through abstraction levels:
1. Source code (human-readable)
2. Lexical tokens (words become symbols)
3. Abstract Syntax Tree (structure emerges)
4. Intermediate representation (neither human nor machine)
5. Assembly (almost machine)
6. Machine code (pure electricity and logic)

Each step loses human meaning but gains machine precision. It's like watching thought become matter.

Modern compilers are also optimizers - they often understand our intent better than we do, rearranging our clumsy instructions into elegant machine ballet.
