# 010 Neural Plasticity - Change Ability

The brain's superpower: rewiring itself. Experience literally
reshapes neural structure.

## Mechanisms
- **Synaptic**: Strength modulation (LTP/LTD)
- **Structural**: New connections, pruning
- **Neurogenesis**: New neurons (hippocampus/olfactory)
- **Homeostatic**: Maintaining stability

## Hebbian Principle
"Cells that fire together, wire together"
- Correlated activity → stronger connection
- Use it or lose it
- Competition for synaptic space

## Critical Periods
- Visual: 0-5 years
- Language: 0-12 years
- Absolute pitch: <6 years
- But adult plasticity continues (slower)

## Implications
Plasticity = learning = adaptation = survival
Without change, no memory, no self, no consciousness.

The hardware that rewrites itself.
