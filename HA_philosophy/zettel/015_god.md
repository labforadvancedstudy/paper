# God

## Core Insight
The ultimate abstraction - infinite everything or necessary nothing.

## The Absolute That Might Not Be

Every culture invents god(s). The pattern is universal: project human qualities to cosmic scale, then remove limitations.

L1: Big parent in sky
L2: Gods control nature
L3: Perfect being (ontological proof)
L4: Necessary existence
L5: Ground of being
L6: Linguistic construct
L7: Projection of power
L8: Omega point
L9: The question behind questions

Nietzsche: "God is dead." But god was always the name for what we don't understand. As understanding grows, god retreats. Or does god just become more abstract?
