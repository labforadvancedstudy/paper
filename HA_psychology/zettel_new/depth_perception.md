# Depth Perception

The brain's clever tricks for extracting 3D information from 2D retinal images. How we avoid walking into walls despite seeing in flatland.

## Binocular Cues
- **Stereopsis**: Each eye's slightly different view
- **Convergence**: Eyes crossing for near objects

## Monocular Cues
- **Relative size**: Smaller = farther
- **Overlap**: Front objects hide back ones
- **Linear perspective**: Parallel lines converge
- **Texture gradient**: Detail decreases with distance
- **Motion parallax**: Near objects move faster

## Development
- 2 months: Some binocular vision
- 4 months: Depth perception emerges
- 6-8 months: Crawling age = cliff avoidance

## When It Fails
- Strabismus (crossed eyes)
- Amblyopia (lazy eye)
- VR sickness (cue conflicts)
- Magic eye pictures
