# Supernova Cosmology

## Core Insight
Type Ia supernovae are standard candles visible across the universe - their consistent brightness let us measure cosmic distances and discover that expansion is accelerating, driven by dark energy.

When white dwarfs accrete matter past the Chandrasekhar limit (1.4 solar masses), they explode with consistent energy. This uniformity makes Type Ia supernovae "standardizable candles." Their peak brightness correlates with decline rate - brighter ones fade slower. After calibration, their distance follows from apparent brightness.

In 1998, two teams studying distant supernovae made a shocking discovery: they were dimmer than expected. The universe's expansion isn't slowing from gravity - it's accelerating. Dark energy, comprising 68% of the universe, drives this acceleration. The discovery won the 2011 Nobel Prize and transformed cosmology. We thought we understood the universe's fate (slow expansion or eventual collapse). Instead, dark energy will drive galaxies apart until the universe becomes cold, empty, and dark. Stellar death revealed cosmic fate. Supernovae became tools for surveying the universe's history and future.
