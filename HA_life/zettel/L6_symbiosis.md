# Symbiosis

## Core Insight
Life discovered that eating your enemies is good, but turning them into partners is genius - the merger and acquisition strategy that built complex life.

Every cell in your body is a Russian doll of ancient alliances. Mitochondria, your cellular power plants, were once free-living bacteria. One day, 2 billion years ago, a cell ate one but didn't digest it. Instead, they struck a deal: "You make energy, I'll protect you." That handshake created all complex life.

Symbiosis is everywhere once you look. Lichens are fungi farming algae. Coral reefs are animals housing photosynthetic tenants. Your gut hosts trillions of bacteria that digest your food in exchange for room and board. You're not an organism - you're an ecosystem pretending to be an individual.

The profound insight: competition isn't the only game. Sometimes cooperation pays better than conflict. When the cost of fighting exceeds the benefit of sharing, life discovers mutualism. The fierce become friends when friendship is profitable.

This changes everything about how we see evolution. It's not just "red in tooth and claw" - it's also holding hands and sharing resources. Major evolutionary transitions often involve former enemies becoming permanent partners. We are built from ancient peace treaties written in DNA.
