# Value Theory

## Core Insight
The eternal question: what makes something worth something? The philosophical heart of economics - where meaning meets measurement.

Value theory asks the unanswerable: is value intrinsic or assigned? Labor or utility? Objective or subjective? Every economic system assumes an answer, building civilizations on philosophical foundations.

Historical answers:
- **Labor theory** - value from human work (Marx)
- **Utility theory** - value from satisfaction (marginalists)
- **Scarcity theory** - value from rarity
- **Power theory** - value from social relations
- **Information theory** - value from knowledge

The paradoxes multiply:
- Water essential but cheap; diamonds useless but dear
- Art worth millions or nothing depending on attribution
- Lives "priceless" but calculated in courts
- Time invaluable but sold hourly
- Ideas free to share but expensively protected

Modern complexity: financial derivatives valued by models valuing models. NFTs selling nothing for fortunes. Attention becoming currency. Value seems increasingly untethered from substance.

The deep truth: value is a story we tell together. When the story changes, fortunes vanish, empires fall. Economics pretends to measure value but really just tracks our collective fiction.
