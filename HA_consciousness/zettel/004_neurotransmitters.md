# 004 Neurotransmitters - Chemical Messengers

The molecular vocabulary of mind. ~100 chemicals encoding 
every thought, feeling, movement.

## Major Players
- **Glutamate**: Primary excitation (80% of synapses)
- **GABA**: Primary inhibition (balance keeper)
- **Dopamine**: Reward, motivation, prediction
- **Serotonin**: Mood, sleep, digestion
- **Acetylcholine**: Attention, muscle control
- **Norepinephrine**: Arousal, vigilance

## Receptor Types
- Ionotropic: Fast, direct channel opening (ms)
- Metabotropic: Slow, cascade effects (seconds-minutes)

## Significance
Same molecule, different receptor = different message
Location matters: Dopamine in striatum (movement) vs cortex (cognition)

Chemistry constrains consciousness. Change the molecules, change the mind.
