# Tactile Communication

Touch: Most honest communication.

Grooming:
- Removes parasites (practical)
- Builds alliances (political)
- Reduces stress (psychological)

Elephant trunks: Handshake + hug.
Ants: Antenna tapping = chemical sampling.
Spiders: Web vibrations = telephone.

Touch requires proximity = trust.
