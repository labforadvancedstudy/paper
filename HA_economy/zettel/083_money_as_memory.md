# Money as Memory

## Core Insight
Currency as civilization's ledger: money doesn't store value, it stores information about past transactions - society's distributed RAM.

Money is memory. Each dollar in your pocket represents someone's past contribution to society, waiting to be redeemed. The economy runs on collective memory of who did what for whom.

Memory functions:
- **Records contributions** - work performed, value created
- **Tracks obligations** - society owes bearer
- **Enables time-shifting** - past effort, future reward
- **Compresses complexity** - infinite transactions → simple balance
- **Distributes knowledge** - no central record needed

Money as database:
- Physical money = distributed ledger
- Bank money = centralized database
- Cryptocurrency = cryptographic memory
- Credit = future memory borrowed
- Debt = negative memory

The profound realization: money isn't wealth, it's wealth's memory. Destroying money doesn't destroy value - it destroys records. Creating money creates claims on future production.

This explains inflation: when memory units proliferate faster than memorable events (production), each unit remembers less. Money forgets.
