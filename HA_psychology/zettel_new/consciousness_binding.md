# Consciousness Binding

## Core Insight
Consciousness is the brain's greatest magic trick - binding scattered processing into unified experience.

Different brain regions process color, motion, sound, meaning - all separately, all at different speeds. Yet you experience one seamless movie, not chaos. This "binding problem" is unsolved: how does meat create unity from multiplicity? The brain somehow tags related signals and synchronizes them into coherent experience. When binding fails - in schizophrenia, psychedelics - reality fractures into pieces.
