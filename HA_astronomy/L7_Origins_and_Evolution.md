# L7: Origins and Evolution

## The Universe Has a History

The cosmos isn't eternal and unchanging but has a beginning, a history, and a future. Stars are born and die. Galaxies collide and merge. The universe itself expands and cools. In this chapter, we explore cosmic evolution - how everything from quarks to galaxy clusters emerged from a hot, dense beginning and continues evolving toward an uncertain future.

### The First Three Minutes

In the beginning was the Big Bang - not an explosion in space but an expansion of space itself. The universe began hot, dense, and nearly uniform. In the first second, fundamental forces separated. Quarks condensed into protons and neutrons. Matter barely won over antimatter, leaving a tiny excess that became everything we see.

By one second, neutrinos decoupled, streaming freely through space. These primordial neutrinos still fill the universe - about 300 per cubic centimeter - but remain undetected. Between one second and three minutes, nuclear fusion occurred. Protons and neutrons combined into helium, traces of lithium, and deuterium. Then the universe cooled below fusion temperatures, fixing primordial abundances.

This primordial nucleosynthesis left fingerprints. The universe is 75% hydrogen, 25% helium by mass - matching Big Bang calculations precisely. No stars needed; the universe's first chemistry happened everywhere simultaneously. Tiny variations in density - one part in 100,000 - seeded all future structure.

### From First Light to First Stars

For 380,000 years, the universe remained opaque. Photons scattered endlessly off free electrons. As expansion cooled the universe below 3000K, electrons combined with nuclei forming neutral atoms. Suddenly transparent, light streamed freely. We see this moment as the cosmic microwave background - the universe's baby picture.

Then came the cosmic dark ages. No stars yet existed. Gravity slowly gathered hydrogen into clumps. Dark matter, feeling only gravity, clumped first, creating wells where normal matter collected. After 100-200 million years, the first stars ignited.

These Population III stars were monsters - 100-1000 solar masses of pure hydrogen and helium. Without heavier elements to radiate heat, gas clouds had to accumulate enormous mass before collapsing. They burned brilliantly but briefly, perhaps only millions of years. Their deaths as supernovae ended the dark ages, seeding space with the first heavy elements and beginning cosmic chemical evolution.

### Galaxies Assemble

Galaxies built hierarchically. Small dark matter halos merged into larger ones. Gas fell into these gravitational wells, forming stars. The first galaxies were small, irregular, intensely star-forming. Through billions of years of mergers, they built today's massive galaxies.

Galaxy formation peaked around 10 billion years ago - "cosmic noon" when star formation rates were ten times higher than today. Young galaxies blazed with hot blue stars. Frequent mergers triggered starbursts. Central black holes grew by accretion, sometimes shining as quasars visible across the universe.

As the universe aged, galaxy evolution slowed. Hot halo gas prevented cooling. Black hole feedback regulated growth. Massive elliptical galaxies - "red and dead" - ceased forming stars. Spiral galaxies like ours continue steady star formation, processing gas into stars over billions of years.

### The Rise of Complexity

Early universe chemistry was simple - hydrogen and helium. Each stellar generation added complexity. First stars created carbon, oxygen, iron. Later generations produced the full periodic table. Supernovae and neutron star mergers created elements heavier than iron.

This chemical evolution enabled complexity. Carbon's unique bonding properties allowed organic molecules. Oxygen enabled water. Metals enabled rocky planets. After 9 billion years of stellar processing, the universe contained sufficient heavy elements for Earth-like planets and life.

Complexity increased at every scale. Atoms formed molecules. Molecules formed dust grains. Dust enabled planet formation. Planets developed atmospheres, geology, and possibly biology. Simple laws operating over billions of years created extraordinary complexity from simple beginnings.

### Cosmic Inflation's Legacy

The standard Big Bang model had problems. Why is the universe so uniform when regions couldn't have communicated? Why is space geometrically flat? Where are magnetic monopoles? Alan Guth's inflation theory solved these puzzles.

In the first 10^-32 seconds, a scalar field drove exponential expansion. The universe increased in size by factor 10^26 or more - a proton expanding to solar system size. This made the universe uniform (by expanding one connected region), flat (like inflating a balloon removes wrinkles), and diluted any monopoles to unobservable rarity.

Inflation's quantum fluctuations, stretched to cosmic scales, seeded all structure. The cosmic microwave background's tiny temperature variations match inflation's predictions. Galaxy distribution follows from these primordial seeds. The universe's largest structures originated from quantum uncertainty at the smallest scales.

### The Accelerating Future

In 1998, observations of distant supernovae revealed shocking news: cosmic expansion is accelerating. Dark energy - representing 68% of the universe's energy - drives this acceleration. Its nature remains mysterious. Vacuum energy? A new field? Modified gravity?

This discovery transformed cosmology's future predictions. Instead of slowing and perhaps reversing, expansion accelerates forever. Galaxies outside our local group will eventually disappear beyond the cosmic horizon. The universe will become cold, dark, and empty - the "Big Freeze."

But the far future holds surprises. Black holes evaporate via Hawking radiation. Protons might decay. quantum tunneling could trigger vacuum decay. The universe's ultimate fate depends on physics we don't yet understand. Time scales are staggering - 10^100 years for the largest black holes to evaporate.

### Life's Cosmic Context

Life on Earth required a specific cosmic history. Early stars created heavy elements. Supernovae distributed them. Second-generation stars formed with planets. Our Sun formed 9 billion years after the Big Bang - late enough for sufficient metallicity, early enough for billions of years of stable evolution.

This timing might not be coincidental. Earlier, insufficient heavy elements existed for rocky planets. Much later, star formation will cease. We exist in a cosmic window when conditions allow complexity and life. The anthropic principle suggests we necessarily find ourselves when and where life is possible.

Life might be rare or common - we don't know. But we know the universe spent 13.8 billion years creating conditions allowing our existence. Every atom in our bodies except hydrogen formed in stars. We are literally cosmic evolution become self-aware.

### Your Evolutionary Observation

Look at the Andromeda Galaxy (visible to naked eye from dark sites). You see it as it was 2.5 million years ago - light travel time. But you also see the future. Andromeda approaches at 110 km/s. In 4 billion years, it will merge with our galaxy, creating a giant elliptical.

Or observe the Pleiades - a young star cluster only 100 million years old. Its hot blue stars won't last long. You're seeing stellar evolution's beginning. Compare to globular cluster M13 - ancient stars 12 billion years old, witnesses to the universe's youth. Time travel through telescope.
