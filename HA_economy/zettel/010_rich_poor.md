# Rich/Poor

## Core Insight
The first economic wound: noticing that some have much while others have little.

A child realizes their friend has more toys, better clothes, bigger house. This recognition - the unequal distribution of stuff - is economics' emotional core. Before theory, before judgment, there's just the raw observation: they have, I don't.

Rich/poor awareness creates:
- **Envy** - wanting what others have
- **Pride** - having what others don't
- **Questions** - why the difference?
- **Aspiration** - I want to be rich too
- **Resentment** - it's not fair!

The child seeing inequality discovers:
- Life isn't equal
- Having affects identity
- Money means possibilities
- Lack means limitation
- The world has hierarchies

This observation drives everything:
- Work (to become less poor)
- Crime (to take from rich)
- Revolution (to redistribute)
- Innovation (to create new wealth)
- Philosophy (to justify or condemn)

Every economic system is an attempt to answer the child's question: "Why do they have more?" The question that launches a thousand ideologies.
