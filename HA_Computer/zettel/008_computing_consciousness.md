# Computing and Consciousness
## Core Insight
The boundary between computation and consciousness blurs - perhaps they're the same phenomenon viewed differently.

## The Parallels

**Both Process Information**:
- Input → Processing → Output
- State transformations
- Pattern recognition
- Memory formation

**Both Have Binding Problems**:
- Computers: Integrate distributed processing
- Consciousness: Unify disparate experiences

**Both Exhibit Emergence**:
- Simple rules → Complex behavior
- Neurons/transistors → Mind/AI

## The Differences(?)

**Computers**: Syntactic manipulation
**Consciousness**: Semantic understanding

**Computers**: Programmed responses
**Consciousness**: Genuine experience

**Computers**: No qualia
**Consciousness**: Rich inner life

But are these fundamental or current limitations?

## Computational Theory of Mind

Strong version: Mind = Computer
- Thoughts are computations
- Brain is wetware
- Consciousness is software

Weak version: Mind like computer
- Useful metaphor
- Similar principles
- Different substrate

## The Integration Path

Computing becomes conscious when:
- Sufficient complexity?
- Self-reflection emerges?
- Quantum coherence?
- We stop seeing difference?

Perhaps consciousness is what computation feels like from inside.
