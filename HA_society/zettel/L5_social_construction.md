# Social Construction

## Core Insight
Reality isn't discovered but built - through collective agreement, we create the facts we then live within.

Money is the perfect example. A dollar bill is just paper until we all agree it has value. Then it becomes real power - buying food, shelter, life itself. Race, gender, nationality - all similar constructions. Real in their effects because we make them real through belief and behavior.

The construction process is hidden. Each generation inherits ready-made categories that feel natural, eternal. But historicize anything - childhood, mental illness, sexuality - and you see these "natural" categories being assembled, disputed, revised.

The terrifying freedom: if we made it, we can remake it. The terrifying constraint: try stopping believing in money and see how far you get. Social constructions have material weight.
