# Justice

## Core Insight
The political ideal of rightness - the ever-contested standard by which we judge whether power's distribution and exercise is proper or perverse.

Justice is politics' North Star, always pointed toward but never reached. Every political system claims to pursue justice while defining it differently. It's simultaneously universal aspiration and particular interpretation.

Justice fractures into types:
- Distributive (who gets what)
- Procedural (how decisions are made)
- Retributive (response to wrongdoing)
- Restorative (healing harm)
- Social (structural fairness)
- Environmental (intergenerational fairness)

The eternal tensions:
- Justice vs mercy
- Individual vs collective justice
- Present vs future justice
- Ideal vs achievable justice
- Universal vs contextual justice

But here's the thing: justice isn't a thing you find, like a buried treasure. It's a thing you make, through struggle, negotiation, and compromise. It's process more than outcome.

The paradox: perfect justice is impossible in an imperfect world. Every attempt creates new injustices. Yet the attempt is what makes us human, political, moral. Justice is the horizon that recedes as we approach but gives direction to the journey.
