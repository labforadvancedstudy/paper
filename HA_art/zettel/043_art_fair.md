# Art Fair

## Core Insight
The temporary mall of culture - where commerce drops its mask, galleries compete in cubicles, and the art world's power dynamics play out in convention center fluorescence.

Art fairs accelerate everything:
- Sales compressed into days
- Viewing becomes marathon
- Decisions made quickly
- FOMO drives purchases
- Exhaustion guaranteed

Hierarchy visible:
- Booth size/location matters
- Main fair vs. satellite
- VIP preview exclusivity
- Invitation-only sections
- Price points segregate

Fair ecosystem complex:
- Mega-fairs dominate (Basel, Frieze)
- Regional fairs serve locals
- Specialized fairs focus (photography, prints)
- Online fairs post-pandemic
- NFT fairs parallel universe

Effects ripple outward:
- Gallery schedules revolve around fairs
- Artists produce for fair deadlines
- Cities compete for fair tourism
- Collectors plan travel schedules
- Critics write fair reports

Contradictions multiply:
- Art as commodity obvious
- Quality vs. salability
- Contemplation impossible
- Context stripped away
- Yet deals get done

Fair fatigue real:
- Too many fairs
- Costs astronomical
- Carbon footprint massive
- Same faces circulating
- Innovation stifled

Alternative models emerging:
- Condo model (galleries swap spaces)
- Digital viewing rooms
- Hybrid physical/virtual
- Time-based releases
- Direct artist sections
