# Transaction

## Core Insight
A transaction is the moment when abstract value becomes real action - the instant where "mine" becomes "yours" and society's invisible agreements become visible exchange.

Watch a simple cash transaction: hand extends money, other hand extends goods, brief moment of simultaneous exchange, both parties walk away transformed. This dance is so fundamental we barely notice it, yet it's the heartbeat of civilization.

The transaction moment contains multitudes:
- Trust (this money is real)
- Agreement (this price is fair)
- Finality (the deal is done)
- Transformation (money → goods)
- Record (even if just in memory)

Every transaction is a tiny ritual reinforcing the collective fiction of money. The cashier doesn't check if you truly "own" those bills - possession is ownership. The exchange happens in seconds but carries centuries of economic evolution.
