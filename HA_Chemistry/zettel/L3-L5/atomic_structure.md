# Atomic Structure

## Core Insight
Atoms are mostly empty space with a dense nucleus - matter is more void than substance, held together by invisible forces.

Imagine a cathedral with a pea at the center. The pea is the nucleus, the cathedral is the atom. Electrons don't orbit like planets - they exist in probability clouds, more like standing waves than particles.

Rutherford shot particles at gold foil, expecting them to bounce back. Most passed straight through. Some bounced back violently. His conclusion: atoms are mostly empty with a tiny, dense core. This shattered the "plum pudding" model forever.

The numbers are staggering. If a nucleus were a marble, electrons would be specks of dust circling a kilometer away. Yet this emptiness gives atoms their size, their chemistry, their ability to bond. The void defines the substance.
