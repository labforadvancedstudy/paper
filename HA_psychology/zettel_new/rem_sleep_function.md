# REM Sleep Function

Rapid Eye Movement sleep serves as the brain's overnight therapy session, processing emotions and consolidating memories through bizarre dream narratives.

## Key Functions
- **Emotional regulation**: Strips emotions from memories
- **Creative insight**: Combines distant concepts
- **Memory integration**: Links new learning to existing knowledge
- **Threat simulation**: Practices responses to dangers

## The Chemistry
During REM, the brain floods with acetylcholine while lacking norepinephrine and serotonin. This unique cocktail allows wild associations while preventing anxiety responses.

## Evidence
People deprived of REM sleep show:
- Increased emotional reactivity
- Poorer creative problem-solving
- Difficulty reading facial expressions
- Memory consolidation deficits
