# Feedback Dynamics

## Core Insight
Feedback loops are causality bent into circles - creating systems where effects become causes, where the future reaches back to shape the present.

Feedback transforms machinery into organism. Positive feedback amplifies (microphone screech, nuclear chain reaction, viral spread). Negative feedback stabilizes (thermostat, homeostasis, market corrections). Together they create complex behaviors from simple rules.

The nonlinear surprise: tiny changes can explode or vanish depending on loop gain. Feedback makes systems unpredictable, sensitive, alive. It's why weather is chaotic, why economies boom and bust, why technologies suddenly dominate.

Understanding feedback is understanding emergence. When outputs become inputs, systems gain memory, develop personality, exhibit purpose. Feedback is how dead matter learns to behave like life - responding, adapting, evolving.
