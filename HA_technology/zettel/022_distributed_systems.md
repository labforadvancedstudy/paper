# Distributed Systems

## Core Insight
Distributed systems achieve unity through multiplicity - creating single behaviors from many actors, proving that coherence doesn't require centralization.

Distribution is consensus without dictator. No single point knows everything, controls everything, or can break everything. Instead, the system emerges from local interactions following global protocols. It's democracy implemented in silicon.

The challenges teach humility: time becomes relative (clock sync), failure becomes partial (Byzantine generals), consistency becomes eventual. Distributed systems force us to abandon comfortable assumptions about order, time, and truth.

From BitTorrent to blockchain to the internet itself: distribution enables scale, resilience, freedom. The cost is complexity - reasoning about systems where causality spreads like ripples, where global state is always outdated, where truth is negotiated not declared.
