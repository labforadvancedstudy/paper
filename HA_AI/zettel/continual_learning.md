# Continual Learning

## Core Insight
The catastrophic forgetting problem - AI learning new tasks erases old knowledge, unlike humans who accumulate wisdom across lifetime.

Teach AI to recognize cats, then dogs. When you test on cats again, it's forgotten them. The new learning overwrote the old. This catastrophic forgetting reveals how different artificial learning is from biological. We add knowledge; AI replaces it. We build on foundations; AI rebuilds from scratch.

Solutions emerge slowly: elastic weights that resist change, memory buffers replaying old tasks, growing architectures that add capacity. But none match the human ability to learn French without forgetting English. The challenge illuminates what makes biological intelligence special - not just learning but remembering while learning.
