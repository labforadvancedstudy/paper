# Democracy

## Core Insight
Rule by the people - the audacious system that claims political power flows up from the governed rather than down from the governors.

Democracy is an impossible idea that somehow works: millions of people with different interests, values, and desires somehow governing themselves collectively. It's organized disagreement with rules.

The democratic paradox: the majority rules, but not absolutely. Democracy must limit itself to remain democratic. It must protect the minority's ability to become the majority, preserve rights that voting can't remove, maintain spaces for dissent.

Forms of democratic alchemy:
- Votes become mandates
- Arguments become policies  
- Conflicts become compromises
- Citizens become sovereigns (temporarily)
- Private opinions become public will

But democracy is more than voting. It requires:
- Public sphere (space for debate)
- Civil society (organized citizens)
- Rule of law (power constrained by rules)
- Free press (information flow)
- Education (capable citizens)

The deep magic: democracy transforms political conflict from violence to voice. Instead of civil war, we have elections. Instead of assassination, we have term limits.

Yet democracy is always incomplete, always becoming rather than being. Each generation must choose it anew.
