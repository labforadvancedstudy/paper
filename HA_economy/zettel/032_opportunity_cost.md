# Opportunity Cost

## Core Insight
The road not taken: every choice murders infinite alternatives - economics is about what we sacrifice.

Opportunity cost is choice made visible. When you choose A, you un-choose everything else. The true cost isn't what you pay, but what you give up. This invisible loss shapes every decision.

Opportunity cost reveals:
- **No free lunch** - everything costs something
- **Time is ultimate constraint** - can't do two things at once
- **Resources have alternative uses** - steel for cars or bridges?
- **Decisions compound** - each choice constrains future choices
- **Implicit costs matter** - unpaid doesn't mean free

Hidden everywhere:
- College costs tuition PLUS foregone wages
- Watching Netflix costs not reading/exercising/working
- Saving money costs not enjoying it now
- Having children costs career advancement
- Every yes implies infinite nos

The entrepreneur sees opportunity cost differently than employee. The young calculate it differently than old. Context is everything.

Understanding opportunity cost is economic enlightenment - seeing the invisible prices on everything, the ghostly alternatives haunting every choice.
