# Burning and Rust

## Core Insight
Fire and rust are the same process at different speeds - oxygen claiming electrons, releasing energy, transforming matter.

Watch a campfire. Orange flames dance, wood becomes ash, heat warms your face. Now look at an old bike - brown rust flaking off metal. One fast, one slow. Both are oxidation.

Fire mesmerizes every child. The transformation is violent, immediate - solid wood vanishing into gas and ash. Rust disappoints - your bike deteriorating, tools weakening. Yet both are oxygen combining with other elements, electrons flowing from one to another.

The energy is the same. Fire releases it in seconds as heat and light. Rust releases it over years, too slowly to notice. It's nature's tax on our metals, returning them to their oxidized state, the forms they prefer.
