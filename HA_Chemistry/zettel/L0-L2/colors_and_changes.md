# Colors and Changes

## Core Insight
Color changes announce chemical transformations - electrons jumping energy levels, making chemistry visible to our eyes.

Purple cabbage juice turns pink with lemon, green with soap. Pennies turn green over time. Silver tarnishes black. Each color change is chemistry waving a flag: "Transformation happening here!"

When molecules change, their electrons rearrange. Different arrangements absorb different colors of light, reflect others. We see the reflected light. A rusting nail going from silver to orange-brown is iron atoms losing electrons, changing how they interact with light.

Children mixing paints discover subtraction - blue and yellow make green because the mixture absorbs red and reflects what remains. But chemistry's colors come from deeper changes - new molecules with new electron arrangements, new ways of dancing with light.
