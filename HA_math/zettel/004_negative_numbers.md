# Negative Numbers and the Extension

## Core Insight
Negative numbers are mathematics' first leap into the abstract - owing what you don't have, going where there's nowhere to go.

## Content
If counting gave us numbers and zero gave us nothing, then what madness is less than nothing? Yet merchants knew debt before mathematicians accepted negative numbers. Reality forced the abstraction.

The number line extends infinitely in both directions, but this symmetry wasn't obvious. For centuries, negative numbers were "false" or "absurd." How can you have negative three apples?

But consider:
- Temperature below freezing
- Debt as negative wealth  
- Movement backward as negative distance
- Time before an event as negative duration

Negative numbers reveal that mathematics isn't about things - it's about relationships. -3 isn't about having negative apples; it's about being 3 units away from zero in the opposite direction from +3.

This conceptual leap enables:
- Subtraction to always work (5 - 8 = -3)
- Equations to have solutions (x + 5 = 2)
- Vectors to point in opposite directions
- Complex numbers to emerge (√-1)

The universe doesn't contain negative numbers - we invented them. But once invented, they reveal hidden symmetries everywhere.
