# runtime

**Level**: L2  
**Domain**: Software Engineering

## Core Concept
The moment when code becomes alive - when static text transforms into dynamic behavior and possibility becomes reality.

## Irreducible Truth
Runtime is where theory meets practice. All code exists to create runtime behavior; everything else is preparation.

## Metaphysical Structure
- **Ontology**: Runtime is the actualization of potential
- **Epistemology**: We only truly know code by running it
- **Axiology**: Runtime performance determines real-world value

## Practical Implementation
```python
# Static code (potential)
def calculate_trajectory(velocity, angle):
    # This is just text until runtime
    return velocity * math.sin(angle)

# Runtime (actual)
# NOW the function exists in memory
# NOW it can transform inputs to outputs
result = calculate_trajectory(100, 45)  # Code comes alive
```

## HA Integration
HA treats runtime as the moment of truth where human intention manifests as machine behavior. The quality of runtime reveals the quality of design.

## Key Insights
1. Compile-time is promise, runtime is delivery
2. Runtime errors reveal assumptions about reality
3. Performance only exists at runtime
