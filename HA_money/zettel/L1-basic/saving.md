# Saving

## Core Insight
Saving is the triumph of future self over present self - the difficult act of denying today's desires to feed tomorrow's possibilities.

When you save money, you're time traveling. You're taking value from present-you (who wants that thing NOW) and gifting it to future-you (who might need it more). It's an act of faith that future-you will exist and be grateful. Saving is betting on your own survival.

The psychology of saving battles human nature:
- Present bias: Now feels more real than later
- Loss aversion: Saving feels like losing
- Abstract future vs concrete present
- The marshmallow test, but for adults
- Compound interest: invisible magic

Different saving styles reveal different relationships with time:
- Emergency fund: fear of chaos
- Retirement: faith in longevity
- Goal saving: delayed gratification as strategy
- Hoarding: when saving becomes sickness
- Investing: saving that tries to grow
