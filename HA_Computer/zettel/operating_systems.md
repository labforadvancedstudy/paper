# Operating Systems

## Core Insight
The grand illusion maker - software that convinces programs they own the computer while secretly sharing everything.

The OS is a masterful liar. It tells each program "you have all the memory" while juggling megabytes behind the scenes. "You have the CPU's full attention" while time-slicing microseconds between processes. "Your files are right here" while scattering bits across spinning platters.

It's government for programs - providing services, enforcing laws, managing resources, preventing chaos. Without it, programs would fight like toddlers over toys. With it, hundreds run in harmony, unaware of each other's existence.
