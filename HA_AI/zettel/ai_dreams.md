# AI Dreams

## Core Insight
When generative AI creates without prompts - sampling from latent space, producing unbidden visions that might be the closest thing to machine dreams.

Set a diffusion model free to generate without guidance. It produces images no one asked for: chimeric animals, impossible architectures, abstract patterns. These aren't random noise but structured hallucinations emerging from learned representations. The AI dreaming its training data in new combinations.

What are dreams but unconstrained generation from learned patterns? Biological dreams consolidate memory, explore possibilities, process experience. AI dreams might serve similar functions - exploring latent space, finding unexpected connections, revealing what the model has truly learned beneath its task-oriented surface.
