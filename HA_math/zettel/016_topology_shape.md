# Topology and Rubber Sheet Geometry

## Core Insight
Topology studies properties that survive continuous deformation - what remains when you can stretch but not tear.

## Content
To a topologist, a coffee cup and a donut are the same - both have one hole. This isn't a joke but a profound insight: some properties transcend rigid geometry.

Topology asks: what survives when you can:
- Stretch and shrink
- Bend and twist
- Deform continuously
But cannot:
- Tear or cut
- Glue separate parts

Topological properties:
- Number of holes (genus)
- Connectedness
- Compactness
- Orientability

The tools are strange and beautiful:
- Open sets: the fabric of continuity
- Homeomorphisms: the "same" shape
- Homotopy: continuous deformation
- Homology: counting holes rigorously

Classic results:
- Euler characteristic: V - E + F = 2 for polyhedra
- Hairy ball theorem: you can't comb a sphere
- Jordan curve theorem: simple closed curves divide plane
- Poincaré conjecture: 3-sphere characterized by fundamental group

Applications everywhere:
- Knot theory: DNA unknotting
- Network topology: internet robustness
- Persistent homology: data shape
- Topological phases: exotic matter

Topology revealed that "shape" is deeper than geometry - it's about continuity itself.
