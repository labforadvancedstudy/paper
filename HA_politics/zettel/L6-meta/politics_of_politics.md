# Politics of Politics

## Core Insight
The struggle over what counts as political - the meta-game where the rules of the game itself are contested.

Before we can do politics, we must decide: what IS politics? This question is itself political. Every answer includes some things and excludes others, empowers some groups and marginalizes others.

Consider what's been declared "political" or "non-political" over time:
- Women's bodies (personal → political)
- Market transactions (political → "natural")
- Sexual relations (private → political → private?)
- Religious belief (political → separate → returning?)

The power to define politics' boundary is perhaps the ultimate political power. Call something "non-political" and you remove it from democratic debate. Call it "political" and you subject it to collective decision.

This boundary-drawing happens through:
- Expertise ("This is a technical matter")
- Nature ("This is just how things are")
- Tradition ("We've always done it this way")
- Emergency ("No time for politics")
- Consensus ("Everyone agrees")

But the boundary is always contested. What seems naturally non-political to one generation becomes intensely political to the next. The "personal is political" didn't discover new territory - it revealed what was always there.

Meta-politics is where politics becomes self-aware, recognizes its own constructed nature, sees its own seeing.
