# Critical Discourse

## Core Insight
Language creating reality - where words about art shape what art becomes, critics and theorists wielding power through interpretation, sometimes overshadowing what they describe.

Critical discourse functions:
- Interpretation (meaning making)
- Evaluation (quality judgment)
- Contextualization (historical placement)
- Theorization (framework building)
- Canonization (importance declaring)

Languages proliferate:
- Formalist (analyzing form)
- Marxist (class/economics)
- Feminist (gender/power)
- Postcolonial (empire/resistance)
- Phenomenological (experience focus)

Power dynamics embedded:
- Who speaks for work?
- Which languages legitimate?
- Academic vs. accessible?
- Artist intention vs. critical reading?
- Market influence on criticism?

International Art English problem:
- Jargon barriers
- Obscurity as authority
- Exclusion through language
- Theory fashion cycles
- Translation losses

Digital disrupts hierarchy:
- Everyone's a critic
- Instagram comments
- Algorithm-driven visibility
- Influencer critics
- Crowdsourced interpretation

Crisis in criticism:
- Publications closing
- Critics becoming curators
- PR replacing criticism
- Market trumping discourse
- Theory exhaustion

Yet discourse essential:
- Creates communities
- Develops languages
- Challenges power
- Preserves memory
- Enables depth

Question: Does art need words? Visual communicates directly. But words create contexts, communities, histories. The conversation continues.
