# Voting

## Core Insight
The physical act of marking a choice - the most basic gesture of political participation, where individual will meets collective decision.

You stand in a booth, alone with a ballot. The pencil hovers. This mark you're about to make joins millions of other marks to somehow become "the people's will."

The experience is paradoxical:
- Profoundly individual (secret ballot, personal choice)
- Fundamentally collective (only matters in aggregate)
- Simultaneously powerful (deciding leadership)
- And powerless (one among millions)

The ritual aspects matter: the journey to the polling place, the queue, showing ID, the privacy of the booth, the folding of the ballot, the slot in the box. These transform a simple mark into a sacred act of citizenship.

That moment of hesitation before marking - that's where all political philosophy compresses into lived experience. Every theory of representation, legitimacy, and collective choice crystallizes in that pause.
