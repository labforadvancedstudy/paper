# API
- **Level**: L4
- **Definition**: The conversation protocol between systems
- **Korean**: API (응용 프로그램 인터페이스)
- **Context**: How programs talk to each other without going insane

## Core Understanding
An API is a contract written in hope and broken in production. It's the diplomatic language between systems that don't trust each other, like a peace treaty negotiated by programs that secretly plot each other's downfall. REST in peace, they say, but the API never rests.

## Deeper Insights
- **REST vs GraphQL**: The eternal holy war of data fetching
- **Versioning**: Because backwards compatibility is a beautiful lie
- **Rate Limiting**: Teaching programs not to be greedy
- **Documentation**: Fiction written by developers, for developers

## Technical Details
```python
# Every API ever written
class UniversalAPI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.version = "1.0"  # Will be deprecated next week
        self.breaking_changes = []  # List grows faster than universe expands
    
    @deprecated("Use v2 instead")  # v2 doesn't exist yet
    def get_data(self, id):
        """
        Returns data, probably.
        
        Possible responses:
        - 200: Here's your data (maybe)
        - 401: Who are you?
        - 403: I know who you are, go away
        - 404: Data? What data?
        - 418: I'm a teapot
        - 500: I have no idea what went wrong
        - 503: I'm tired, try again later
        """
        if random.random() > 0.1:  # 90% uptime SLA
            return {"data": "Here you go", "deprecated": True}
        else:
            raise RandomProductionError("¯\\_(ツ)_/¯")
    
    def post_data(self, data):
        # Validate nothing, trust everything
        # What could possibly go wrong?
        return {"status": "Probably saved", "id": uuid4()}
```

## Connection to Truth
APIs represent the fundamental challenge of communication: how do we share meaning across boundaries? Every API is a tower of Babel, reaching toward mutual understanding but often collapsing into incompatible dialects. The 404 error is philosophy's "thing-in-itself"—we know something should be there, but we cannot access it.

## When It Matters
- **Integration**: When systems need to hold hands
- **Microservices**: Everyone gets an API!
- **Third-party Services**: Trusting strangers with your data
- **Mobile Apps**: Because the frontend lives elsewhere

## Human Element
API design is an exercise in empathy. You're creating an interface for a developer you'll never meet, who will curse your name at 2 AM when your documentation lies. Every endpoint is a promise, every response code a small betrayal. The best APIs are love letters to future developers; the worst are ransoms notes written in JSON.
