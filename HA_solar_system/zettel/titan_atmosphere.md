# Titan Atmosphere

## Core Insight
Saturn's moon Titan has the Solar System's only other thick atmosphere besides Earth's - a smoggy nitrogen shroud hiding methane lakes and organic chemistry that might mirror early Earth.

Titan breaks moon rules. Most moons are airless; Titan's atmosphere is thicker than Earth's. Nitrogen dominates, like Earth, but methane plays water's role. Methane rains from orange skies, fills lakes, evaporates, and rains again - a complete hydrological cycle at -180°C. The thick atmosphere creates greenhouse warming and anti-greenhouse cooling, maintains surface pressure that allows liquid methane, and blocks views of the surface in visible light.

Beneath the haze lies an alien yet familiar world. River channels carved by methane. Shorelines shaped by hydrocarbon waves. Dunes of water ice covered in organic gunk. Complex organic chemistry rains from the sky - tholins that might resemble early Earth's primordial soup, frozen in time. Titan shows us what Earth might have been before life changed everything, a natural laboratory for prebiotic chemistry preserved in deep freeze.
