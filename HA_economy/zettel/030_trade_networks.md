# Trade Networks

## Core Insight
The web of want satisfaction: how local exchanges link into global flow - humanity's circulatory system.

Trade networks are relationships made material. Each link represents trust, each node a transformation point. From silk roads to shipping lanes to fiber optic cables - networks carry humanity's metabolism.

Network characteristics:
- **Connectivity** - more links, more resilience
- **Centrality** - some nodes matter more
- **Flow dynamics** - goods, money, information
- **Network effects** - value grows with size
- **Vulnerability** - critical node failure cascades

Networks enable:
- Specialization at distance
- Risk distribution
- Knowledge transfer
- Price discovery
- Cultural exchange

The profound shift: from simple chains (farmer → market → consumer) to complex webs where Brazilian rain affects European bread prices. Everything connects to everything.

Modern extreme: supply chains so complex no one understands them fully. A chip shortage in Taiwan halts car production globally. Efficiency gained, fragility increased.

Networks reveal economics is ecology - interconnected, interdependent, evolving.
