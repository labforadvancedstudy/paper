# Autocomplete Magic

## Core Insight
The moment your phone finishes your sentence before you do - AI so embedded in daily life we forget it's artificial intelligence.

You start typing "How do I..." and your keyboard suggests "get to the airport." It knew. Not because it's psychic, but because millions before you asked the same thing. This is AI at its most invisible and pervasive - predicting the next word based on patterns in human communication.

What began as simple word frequency became context awareness. Your phone knows you text "love you" to family, "regards" to colleagues. It learns your typos, your shortcuts, your voice. The AI isn't in some distant server - it's in your pocket, learning you, becoming you.
