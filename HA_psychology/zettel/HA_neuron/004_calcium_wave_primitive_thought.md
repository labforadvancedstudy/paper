## The First Collective Computation

When calcium ions surge through a network of cells,
we witness the first glimmer of what will become thought -
a wave of information propagating through living matter.

### The Wave Phenomenon
- Not just one cell responding, but many
- Information spreads like ripples in a pond
- Each cell both receiver and transmitter
- The birth of biological broadcasting

### Calcium: The Universal Messenger
Why calcium? 
- Large gradient maintained (10,000:1)
- Triggers numerous cellular responses
- Can encode both amplitude and frequency
- The first "neurotransmitter" before neurons existed

### Proto-Thoughts in Motion
These waves carry:
- Warnings of danger
- Coordination signals
- Metabolic states
- The first "ideas" shared between cells
