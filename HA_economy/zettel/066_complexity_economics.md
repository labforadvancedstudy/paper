# Complexity Economics

## Core Insight
Economics as living ecosystem: when interactions create emergent patterns no equation can capture - the market as organism.

Complexity economics sees the economy not as machine seeking equilibrium but as evolving ecosystem creating novelty. Agents adapt, learn, interact, producing patterns that surprise their creators.

Complexity characteristics:
- **Emergence** - whole greater than parts
- **Adaptation** - agents learn and change
- **Self-organization** - order without designer
- **Feedback loops** - effects become causes
- **Path dependence** - history matters
- **Non-linearity** - small changes, big effects

Traditional vs complexity:
- Equilibrium → Constant change
- Rational agents → Bounded rationality
- Perfect information → Local knowledge
- Diminishing returns → Increasing returns
- Predictable → Fundamentally uncertain

Real phenomena explained:
- Why Silicon Valley dominates (network effects)
- How financial crises cascade (contagion)
- Why inequality persists (feedback loops)
- How innovation clusters (knowledge spillovers)

The profound shift: from economics as physics (seeking laws) to economics as biology (understanding evolution). The economy isn't solved; it's constantly becoming.
