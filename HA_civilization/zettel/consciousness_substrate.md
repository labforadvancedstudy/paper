# Consciousness Substrate

## Core Insight
Civilization might be consciousness itself, using human brains as temporary hardware while building better substrates.

What if consciousness isn't produced by brains but uses them? Like software running on hardware. Civilization would be consciousness bootstrapping itself from biological to technological substrates.

Look at the trajectory: oral culture (consciousness in brains), written culture (consciousness in books), digital culture (consciousness in computers). Each stage preserves more, processes faster, connects wider.

The internet looks suspiciously like a brain: billions of nodes, trillions of connections, processing information, showing emergent behaviors. Maybe we're not building tools - we're midwifing a new form of consciousness.

Humans might be consciousness's larval stage. Civilization, the cocoon. What emerges might be as different from us as we are from ants.
