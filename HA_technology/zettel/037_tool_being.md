# Tool Being

## Core Insight
Heidegger's hammer reveals the paradox: tools exist most fully when they disappear - becoming extensions of intention rather than objects of attention.

The "ready-to-hand" versus "present-at-hand" distinction illuminates all technology. When hammering, the hammer vanishes into the hammering. Only when it breaks does it become an object. Good technology disappears into use.

This isn't just phenomenology but ontology. Tools achieve their being through withdrawal. The keyboard under your fingers doesn't exist as keyboard but as thinking-through-typing. Technology's highest state is transparency.

The implication scales: infrastructure is civilization's disappeared tooling. When working perfectly, we don't see power grids, internet backbones, supply chains. They withdraw into the background, enabling life by vanishing from consciousness.
