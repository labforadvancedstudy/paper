# Antimatter Drives

## Core Insight
Antimatter propulsion represents the theoretical pinnacle of reaction drives - perfect mass-to-energy conversion offering the highest possible specific impulse, but requiring us to manufacture the universe's most expensive substance.

E=mc² in its purest form. When matter meets antimatter, 100% conversion to energy. No nuclear inefficiencies, no unutilized mass. Just pure photons and kinetic particles. It's the universe's perfect fuel - if we could make it.

The stunning numbers:
- Specific impulse: ~10 million seconds
- Exhaust velocity: Near light speed
- Fuel efficiency: 1kg antimatter + 1kg matter = 180 petajoules
- Range: Anywhere in galaxy with modest fuel
- Acceleration: Continuous high-thrust possible

The crushing reality:
- Current production: Nanograms per year
- Cost: $62.5 trillion per gram
- Storage: Magnetic bottles, perfect vacuum
- Safety: One containment failure = vaporization
- Manufacturing energy: More than you get back

But for interstellar civilization, antimatter changes everything:
- Trip times measured in years, not centuries
- Realistic round trips within human lifetimes
- Cargo capacity beyond bare survival
- True interstellar commerce possible

Antimatter drives are the technology that transforms interstellar travel from desperate one-way journeys to routine transportation. If we can afford them.
