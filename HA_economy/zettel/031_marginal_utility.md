# Marginal Utility

## Core Insight
The law of diminishing joy: first slice of pizza is heaven, tenth is hell - value lives at the margin.

Marginal utility explains why billionaires aren't a billion times happier than thousandaires. Each additional unit of something provides less satisfaction than the previous. This simple insight revolutionized economics.

Marginal thinking reveals:
- **Value is contextual** - depends on how much you have
- **Decisions happen at edges** - not average but next unit
- **Trade creates value** - your low marginal becomes my high
- **Price reflects margins** - not total but next unit's worth
- **Satisfaction curves** - more isn't always better

Applications everywhere:
- Why all-you-can-eat buffets work
- Why drug tolerance develops
- Why first love hits hardest
- Why raises matter less over time
- Why variety is spice of life

The profound implication: there's no absolute value, only marginal value. A glass of water is worthless to someone by a river, priceless to someone in a desert.

This kills the labor theory of value - things aren't worth what they cost to make, but what the next person needing them will pay.
