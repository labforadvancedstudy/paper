# Ethics

## Core Insight
The rules we make for living together - morality systematized.

## The Should Problem

You can't derive ought from is. No amount of facts tell you what to do. Yet we must act. Ethics is the bridge we build across the gap.

L1: Help friends, hurt enemies
L2: Obey divine commands
L3: Cultivate virtues
L4: Follow universal law
L5: Maximize happiness
L6: Social contracts
L7: Power negotiations
L8: Game theory optimization
L9: Ethical landscapes

The perpetual war: deontology (rules) vs consequentialism (results) vs virtue ethics (character).
