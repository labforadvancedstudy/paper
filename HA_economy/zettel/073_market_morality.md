# Market Morality

## Core Insight
Markets aren't just mechanisms for exchange - they're moral systems that shape values, relationships, and what we consider sacred versus saleable.

Michael Sandel asks: what money shouldn't buy? We're queasy about markets in organs, babies, votes, friendship. Why? Because putting a price on something changes its meaning. A kidney donated is a gift of life. A kidney sold is spare parts.

Markets transform moral relationships into commercial ones. Care becomes service. Loyalty becomes retention. Community becomes network. This isn't always bad - markets can eliminate discrimination (money is colorblind) and create freedom (exit options).

But market logic colonizes ever more spheres. Education becomes human capital investment. Environmental protection becomes carbon credits. Even charity gets marketized - effective altruism calculates optimal good per dollar.

The deeper issue: markets don't just allocate goods, they express and promote certain values - efficiency, individualism, quantification. When everything has a price, nothing has inherent worth. When all relationships are transactional, community withers.

There's also market fundamentalism - the faith that markets are always moral because voluntary exchange is inherently just. This ignores power imbalances, information asymmetries, and desperate circumstances that make "voluntary" a cruel joke.

The question isn't whether markets are good or evil - they're tools. The question is where market logic enhances human flourishing and where it corrupts what we value. Drawing those lines is ethics, not economics.
