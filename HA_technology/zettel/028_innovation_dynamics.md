# Innovation Dynamics

## Core Insight
Innovation isn't invention - it's the successful insurgency of new ideas against the empire of the established, requiring not just creation but conquest.

Innovation follows predictable patterns. First, the adjacent possible: new ideas emerge only when prerequisite technologies exist. You can't invent radio before discovering electromagnetic waves. Innovation explores the reachable from the real.

Then comes resistance. Existing systems defend themselves - through network effects, sunk costs, regulatory capture, cultural inertia. Most innovations die here, not because they're inferior but because they can't overcome systemic antibodies.

Success requires alignment: technical feasibility, economic viability, social acceptability, regulatory navigability. Innovation isn't just solving technical problems but threading the needle of systemic constraints. It's evolution in hostile territory.
