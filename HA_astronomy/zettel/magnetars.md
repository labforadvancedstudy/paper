# Magnetars

## Core Insight
Magnetars are the universe's most powerful magnets - neutron stars with fields a quadrillion times Earth's, so strong they could erase credit cards from the Moon and distort atoms into pencil shapes.

Among neutron stars, magnetars are the extreme outliers. Their magnetic fields reach 10^15 gauss (Earth's is 0.5 gauss). These fields power extraordinary phenomena. Starquakes crack the neutron star crust, releasing more energy in a tenth of a second than the Sun emits in 100,000 years. The magnetic field reconfigures violently, producing gamma-ray flares visible across galaxies.

Near a magnetar, physics goes weird. The magnetic field exceeds the quantum electrodynamic threshold where vacuum becomes birefringent - light splits by polarization. Atoms stretch into cylinders 200 times narrower than normal. At 1000 kilometers, the field would kill by diamagnetically ripping water molecules from cells. Magnetars are young, their fields decaying over ~10,000 years through magnetic braking and field dissipation. Only about 30 are known. They represent nature's exploration of extreme magnetic physics - laboratories we could never build.
