## The CEO of Consciousness

The prefrontal cortex represents the pinnacle
of neural evolution - where impulses become decisions,
and reactions become reflections.

### Executive Functions
- Working memory: Holding information online
- Inhibitory control: Saying no to impulses
- Cognitive flexibility: Switching strategies
- The neural basis of free will?

### The Delay Between Stimulus and Response
- Other brain regions: milliseconds
- Prefrontal cortex: seconds to minutes
- The space where choice lives
- Consciousness as delayed reaction

### Meta-Cognitive Capabilities
- Thinking about thinking
- Planning future actions
- Evaluating own mental states
- The observer observing itself

### The Human Difference
- Disproportionately enlarged in humans
- Last to mature (mid-twenties)
- First to decline in aging
- The most "human" part of the brain
