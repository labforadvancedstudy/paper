# Protein Folding

## Core Insight
The most complex origami in the universe - where a 1D string becomes a 3D machine in microseconds.

A protein starts as a chain of amino acids - like a necklace of 20 different bead types. But the moment it's made, it starts folding. In microseconds to seconds, this floppy string becomes a precise 3D shape. And shape is EVERYTHING.

The folding follows rules but seems magical. Hydrophobic amino acids hide inside. Charged ones face outward. Cysteines form bridges. But predicting the final shape from the sequence? We needed AI (AlphaFold) to crack it.

One wrong fold = disaster. Prions are just normal proteins folded wrong, yet they cause mad cow disease. Alzheimer's involves misfolded proteins. Cancer often hijacks folding machinery. Life depends on getting this origami perfect millions of times per second.

The paradox: there are more possible ways to fold a protein than atoms in the universe. Yet each protein finds its ONE correct shape reliably. It's like dropping a string and having it land as a perfect crane every time.
