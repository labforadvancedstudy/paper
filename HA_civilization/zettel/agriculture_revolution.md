# Agriculture Revolution

## Core Insight
Agriculture was humanity's first deal with the future - betting starvation today against abundance tomorrow.

For 200,000 years, humans ate what they found. Then someone had an insane idea: "What if we put seeds in the ground and just... wait?" That's delayed gratification on a species level.

Agriculture didn't make life easier - it made it harder. Farmers work more hours than hunter-gatherers. Their diet is worse. Their backs hurt. Diseases spread faster in settlements. So why do it?

Because agriculture creates **surplus**. Extra food means some people don't have to find food. They can be priests, warriors, artists, kings. Agriculture doesn't just grow crops - it grows complexity.

We domesticated wheat, but wheat domesticated us right back. We became its servants, clearing land, pulling weeds, spreading its seeds across the planet.
