# Norms

## Core Insight
The unwritten rules that make society predictable - what "everyone knows" without being taught explicitly.

Stand in an elevator and face the back wall. Watch everyone's discomfort. You've broken a norm - not a law, not even a stated rule, just "what we do." Norms are society's operating system, running in the background, invisible until violated.

Norms range from trivial (which way to face in elevators) to fundamental (don't eat your dead). They're enforced not by police but by raised eyebrows, uncomfortable silence, and social exclusion. 

The genius of norms is their flexibility. Laws are binary (legal/illegal), but norms exist on a spectrum, bending with context. Yelling is wrong in libraries, expected at football games.
