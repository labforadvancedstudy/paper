# The Definition Problem

## Core Insight
Every attempt to define life excludes something we feel should be included or includes something we feel shouldn't be.

Fire reproduces, consumes, grows, responds to environment, maintains itself. Is it alive? Viruses have genes, evolve, reproduce (with help). Are they alive? AI systems learn, adapt, self-modify. Will they be alive?

Traditional definitions fail:
- Reproduction? Mules can't but are alive
- Metabolism? Dormant seeds have none
- Growth? Crystals grow
- Evolution? Individual organisms don't evolve
- Cells? Viruses lack them

Maybe the problem is trying to draw a sharp line where nature provides a gradient. Life might not be binary but a spectrum. Or maybe "life" is a human category imposed on a universe that doesn't care about our definitions.

The deeper issue: we're life trying to define life. Can a system fully understand itself? Is our failure to define life actually life's success at transcending definition?
