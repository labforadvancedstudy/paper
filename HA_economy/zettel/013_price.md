# Price

## Core Insight
The economy's language: a single number encoding all of society's desires, costs, and expectations.

Price is information compression at its finest. That "$3.99" contains multitudes - cost of production, competition levels, consumer desire, profit margins, future expectations. Price is how the economy talks.

Price communicates:
- **Scarcity** - rare things cost more
- **Desire** - wanted things cost more
- **Cost** - expensive-to-make costs more
- **Competition** - many sellers means lower price
- **Information** - price changes signal market shifts

Price coordinates without central planning:
- High price says "make more of this"
- Low price says "make less of this"
- Rising price says "opportunity here"
- Falling price says "oversupply warning"

The miracle: millions of individual decisions create prices that guide the economy without anyone in charge. Price is emergent wisdom, distributed calculation, collective intelligence.

From haggling in bazaars to microsecond algorithmic trading, price remains the economy's fundamental communication protocol. Every price is a compressed story of human desires and constraints.
