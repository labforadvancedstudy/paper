# Confirmation Bias

## Core Insight
Your brain is a lawyer, not a scientist - it seeks evidence to win, not truth.

We don't see and then believe; we believe and then see. Your brain actively hunts for evidence that you're right while ignoring what proves you wrong. It's not stupidity - it's efficiency gone wrong. Changing beliefs is metabolically expensive, so your brain protects existing ones like a miser. That's why fact-checking backfires: showing people they're wrong often makes beliefs stronger. The brain treats attacks on ideas like attacks on self.
