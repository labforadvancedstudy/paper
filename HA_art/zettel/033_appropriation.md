# Appropriation

## Core Insight
Taking as making - where context shift creates new meaning, questioning ownership, originality, and the nature of creation itself in an always-already-quoted world.

Appropriation acknowledges: nothing comes from nothing. All art references, quotes, steals. Difference lies in degree and acknowledgment:
- Homage: respectful reference
- Parody: critical mimicry
- Pastiche: style imitation
- Plagiarism: hidden theft
- Appropriation: conceptual claiming

Duchamp started it. Fountain (1917) - urinal becomes art through designation. Not making but choosing. Context creates content. Museum transforms object.

Strategies multiply:
- Re-photography (Sherrie Levine)
- Re-painting (Mike Bidlo)
- Re-contextualizing (Jeff Koons)
- Sampling (music parallel)
- Meme-making (democratic appropriation)

Legal battles reveal tensions:
- Copyright vs. creativity
- Fair use interpretations
- Transformative threshold
- Market harm considerations
- Cultural ownership questions

Digital explodes appropriation:
- Everything copyable
- Sources trace-able/erasable
- Attribution complex
- Ownership disputed
- NFTs attempt solution

Power dynamics matter:
- Who appropriates whom?
- Cultural extraction
- Economic implications
- Historical inequities
- Credit/compensation

Contemporary condition: we swim in images. Advertising, social media, entertainment. Appropriation becomes survival strategy - using commercial language against itself. Or with it? Line blurs.
