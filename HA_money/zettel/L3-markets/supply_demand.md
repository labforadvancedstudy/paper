# Supply and Demand

## Core Insight
Supply and demand is the universe's price discovery mechanism - the invisible hand that finds the exact point where human desire meets human effort, creating value from thin air.

Watch a farmer's market: too many tomatoes, prices drop. Last basket of strawberries? Prices rise. This isn't conspiracy - it's communication. Prices are information compressed into numbers, telling us instantly what society values right now. The market is a vast neural network, processing millions of desires and decisions into single digits.

The elegant brutality:
- Scarcity creates value automatically
- Abundance destroys it just as fast
- Every price is a temporary truce
- Equilibrium is always moving
- Individual powerlessness, collective power

Supply and demand seems simple: more supply = lower price, more demand = higher price. But emergence creates complexity: speculation, manipulation, bubbles, crashes. The same force that prices your coffee also created tulip mania and housing bubbles.
