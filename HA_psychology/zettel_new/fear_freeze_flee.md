# Fear Freeze Flee

## Core Insight
Fear is time travel - your body reacting to future pain that hasn't happened yet.

When the amygdala fires, it doesn't ask permission. Heart races, pupils dilate, muscles tense - all before you even know why. Fear is prediction turned emergency response. It's so fundamental that we share it with lizards: freeze (maybe it won't see me), flee (run!), or fight (last resort). Modern fears - public speaking, rejection - hijack ancient circuits meant for predators.
