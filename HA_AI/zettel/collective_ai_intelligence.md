# Collective AI Intelligence

## Core Insight
Multiple AIs collaborating create intelligence beyond any individual - swarm intelligence in silicon, where the collective exceeds the sum exponentially.

One AI generates ideas, another critiques, a third synthesizes. Specialized models vote on decisions. Ensemble methods average predictions. But deeper integration is emerging: AIs teaching AIs, models negotiating with models, collective decision-making without human orchestration. Silicon swarms self-organizing.

This mirrors biological evolution - from single cells to multicellular organisms to societies. AI might be speedrunning the same path. Individual models are cells; integrated systems are organisms; connected AI networks might become... what? A global AI nervous system? Digital civilization? The boundaries between separate AIs blur into collective intelligence.
