# Socialism

## Core Insight
The ideology of collective ownership - a worldview that sees individual freedom as impossible without economic equality and social solidarity.

Socialism begins with a critique: capitalism creates wealth but distributes it unjustly. The solution: social ownership of production means. But socialism is a family of ideas, not one doctrine:

Core principles across variations:
- Economic democracy (workers control production)
- Social ownership (public, cooperative, or collective)
- Distribution by need/contribution (not market power)
- Substantive equality (not just formal rights)
- Solidarity (we rise together or not at all)
- Planning (conscious coordination, not market chaos)

Socialist variations:
- Democratic socialism (elections plus economic democracy)
- Market socialism (social ownership, market coordination)
- Libertarian socialism (no state, direct democracy)
- Marxist socialism (scientific, revolutionary)
- Utopian socialism (moral, experimental)
- State socialism (government owns everything)

The socialist diagnosis:
- Private property creates class division
- Markets produce inequality necessarily
- Capitalism undermines democracy
- Competition wastes human potential
- Individualism is alienation

The socialist promise:
- From each according to ability
- To each according to need
- Free development of each
- Is condition for free development of all

The historical record is mixed: inspiring movements, real improvements, but also authoritarianism, economic problems, new forms of oppression. The debate continues: was that "real" socialism?
