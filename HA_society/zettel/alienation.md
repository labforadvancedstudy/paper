# Alienation

## Core Insight
The strange condition of being separated from what we create, who we are, and each other - modernity's defining disease.

Marx saw it first in factories: workers alienated from their product (making things they can't afford), process (repetitive fragments), species-being (creating becoming mechanical), and each other (competing not cooperating).

But alienation metastasized beyond work. We're alienated from our bodies (medicine manages them), minds (experts explain them), relationships (apps mediate them), even selves (brands define them). Everything human becomes strange, external, beyond control.

The alienation paradox: the systems we build to serve us become alien powers ruling us. The economy "demands" sacrifice. Technology "requires" adaptation. We created these gods and now pray to them, forgetting we're praying to ourselves.
