# Origins and Endings

## Core Insight
Chemistry began with the first stars and will end with proton decay - we exist in a brief window where complex chemistry is possible.

After the Big Bang, only hydrogen and helium. No chemistry possible - just two elements. First stars formed, fused hydrogen to helium, helium to carbon. Stellar nucleosynthesis created the periodic table. Supernovae scattered these elements, seeding space with chemistry's raw materials.

We live in chemistry's golden age. Temperature allows liquid water. Element abundances permit complexity. But it's temporary. Stars will die, universe will cool. Eventually, proton decay will destroy all nuclei. Chemistry will end.

Between origin and ending, chemistry created us. We're star stuff contemplating stars, chemistry studying itself. The universe evolved eyes to see itself, brains to understand itself. We're how cosmos does chemistry - temporarily, beautifully, consciously.
