# Control Theory

## Core Insight
Control theory is the mathematics of intention - transforming desire into reality through feedback loops that measure, compare, and correct until the world matches our will.

Control begins with error - the gap between what is and what should be. Measure the error, multiply by gain, apply correction, measure again. This simple loop tames everything from thermostats to spacecraft.

The magic is in feedback. Open-loop control is hope. Closed-loop control is engineering. Feedback makes systems self-correcting, self-stabilizing, seemingly intelligent. It's how dumb components create smart behavior.

PID controllers - Proportional, Integral, Derivative - are control theory's Swiss Army knife. P responds to present error, I to past accumulation, D to future trend. Together, they make machines that anticipate and adapt. Control theory turns mechanisms into organisms.
