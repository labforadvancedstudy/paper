# Being Company

## Core Insight
We don't work for companies - we ARE companies, our identities so intertwined with organizational existence that separation becomes illusion.

Consider: you wake at company time, dress in company clothes, speak company language, think company thoughts. Your skills shaped by company needs. Your relationships formed through company connections. Your identity includes company affiliation. Where do you end and company begin?

Deeper: we're all parts of multiple companies simultaneously. Customer of hundreds, investor through pensions, citizen of corporate-shaped society. Companies aren't separate from human life but the medium through which modern life occurs. We swim in corporate reality.

The final recognition: perhaps individual humans are to companies as cells are to bodies. We imagine ourselves independent, but we're components in larger organisms. Companies think through us, act through us, evolve through us. We are the substrate of corporate being.
