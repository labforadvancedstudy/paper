# Social Ontology

## Core Insight
The fundamental question of what society IS - not how it works but whether it exists and in what sense.

Does society exist beyond individuals? Nominalists say no - only people are real; "society" is just our name for patterns. Realists say yes - society has properties individuals don't, like consciousness has properties neurons don't.

The ontological puzzle: society is made of individuals but can't be reduced to them. Like water isn't just H2O molecules but their arrangement, society isn't just people but their relations. But relations between what? If individuals are already social, what's prior?

Perhaps the division is false. Maybe there are no individuals, only nodes in networks. Or no society, only interacting bodies. Or both individual and society are processes, not things - verbs mistaken for nouns in languages too crude for fluid reality.
