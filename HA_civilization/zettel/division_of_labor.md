# Division of Labor

## Core Insight
When humans stopped trying to do everything and started doing one thing well, civilization's complexity exploded exponentially.

In a hunter-gatherer band, everyone's a generalist. Everyone hunts, gathers, makes tools, tells stories. But the moment someone says "I'll just make pots, you hunt" - boom. Specialization.

Now the potter gets really good at pots. Discovers new techniques. Makes better pots than any generalist could. The hunter gets better at hunting. Both benefit. 1+1 suddenly equals 3.

But here's the cost: specialists can't survive alone. A master blacksmith who can't farm will starve. Division of labor creates mutual dependence. We become organs in a larger organism, unable to function independently.

This is civilization's deal with the devil: incredible collective power bought with individual helplessness.
