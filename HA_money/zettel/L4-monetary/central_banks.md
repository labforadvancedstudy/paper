# Central Banks

## Core Insight
Central banks are the reality engineers of modern economy - institutions with the godlike power to create money from nothing and the terrible responsibility of keeping the collective hallucination stable.

A central bank doesn't have money - it creates money. When the Federal Reserve buys bonds, it doesn't transfer existing dollars; it types new ones into existence. This isn't counterfeiting; it's the authorized miracle that makes modern economy possible. They are the dungeon masters of the monetary game, adjusting rules to keep play balanced.

The tools of monetary gods:
- Interest rates: the price of money itself
- Money supply: creating/destroying dollars
- Reserve requirements: how much banks must hold
- Forward guidance: speaking reality into existence
- Quantitative easing: emergency money printing

The profound weirdness: an institution that can never run out of money, tasked with making sure money stays valuable. They fight inflation (money becoming worthless) and deflation (money becoming too valuable). They're tightrope walkers, and the rope is confidence itself.
