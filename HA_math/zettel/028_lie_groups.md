# Lie Groups and Continuous Symmetry

## Core Insight
Lie groups are symmetries you can continuously vary - they're simultaneously groups, manifolds, and the key to understanding physical laws.

## Content
Discrete symmetries jump: rotate 90°, reflect, permute. Continuous symmetries flow: rotate by any angle, translate any distance. Lie groups capture these flowing symmetries.

A Lie group is:
- A group (algebraic structure)
- A manifold (geometric structure)
- Where multiplication and inversion are smooth

Examples illuminate:
- SO(3): rotations in 3D space
- U(1): complex phases (electromagnetism)
- SU(2): quantum spin
- SL(n,ℝ): volume-preserving transformations

The magic is the Lie algebra:
- Tangent space at identity
- Infinitesimal generators
- Bracket captures non-commutativity
- Exponential map: algebra → group

Key insight: global structure determined by local (infinitesimal) structure.

Deep connections:
- Physics: symmetries → conservation laws (Noether)
- Differential equations: symmetry methods
- Representation theory: how groups act
- Geometry: principal bundles

Classification achieved:
- Simple Lie groups classified (Killing, Cartan)
- Exceptional groups: E₈ has 248 dimensions
- Semisimple = product of simple
- Root systems encode everything

Lie groups revealed that continuous symmetry has discrete structure underneath.
