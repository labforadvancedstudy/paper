# Zero as Void and Number

## Core Insight
Zero is the mathematical koan - the presence of absence, the something that is nothing.

## Content
For most of human history, zero didn't exist. Not because we couldn't conceive of nothing, but because we couldn't conceive of nothing as something worth writing down.

The Babylonians had a placeholder, the Greeks philosophically rejected it, but it was Indian mathematicians who truly birthed zero as a number. They asked: what do you get when you take 3 away from 3? Not "nothing" - but "zero."

Zero broke mathematics and rebuilt it stronger:
- Division by zero creates infinity's shadow
- Zero multiplied by anything consumes it
- Zero added to anything leaves it unchanged
- Zero to the power of zero sparks philosophical wars

But zero's true power isn't in arithmetic - it's in what it enables. Negative numbers only make sense once you have zero as the fulcrum. Calculus needs zero to define the infinitesimal. Computer science is built on zero's duality with one.

Zero is the membrane between positive and negative, the origin of coordinate systems, the ground state of existence. It's not just a number - it's the number that makes all other numbers possible.
