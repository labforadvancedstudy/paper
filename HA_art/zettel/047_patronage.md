# Patronage

## Core Insight
The ancient bargain - where wealth seeks immortality through art, creating dependencies that shape what gets made while enabling creation that markets alone wouldn't support.

Patronage evolves but persists:
- Church commissions (spiritual capital)
- Royal collections (power display)
- Merchant princes (status seeking)
- Industrial philanthropists (reputation washing)
- Corporate sponsorship (brand association)

Contemporary forms multiply:
- Crowdfunding (micro-patronage)
- Grants (bureaucratic patronage)
- Residencies (time/space gift)
- Commissions (specific support)
- Subscriptions (ongoing support)

Power relationships complex:
- Patron vision vs. artist freedom
- Public benefit vs. private taste
- Dependence vs. independence
- Gratitude vs. resentment
- Credit vs. anonymity

What patrons buy:
- Immortality (name on building)
- Status (cultural capital)
- Access (artist relationships)
- Influence (aesthetic direction)
- Legacy (historical position)

Modern complications:
- Tax benefits drive giving
- Naming rights negotiations
- Board positions expected
- Storage/conservation costs
- Ethical money questions

Digital disrupts patterns:
- Patreon direct support
- NFT patron rewards
- DAO collective patronage
- Cryptocurrency volatility
- Global patron pools

Yet need remains: Art requires time, space, materials. Markets fail experimental work. Public funding limited. Private patronage fills gaps, extracts prices. Ancient dance continues.
