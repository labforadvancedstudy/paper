# Performance

## Core Insight
The body as brush, time as canvas - where artist becomes artwork, collapsing the distance between creator and creation, making presence itself the medium.

Performance art emerged from painting's limits. Pollock's action painting suggested next step: remove canvas, keep action. The body doing becomes the work:
- Duration: time structures experience
- Presence: liveness cannot be reproduced
- Risk: real consequences, real pain possible
- Ephemeral: exists then vanishes
- Documentation: trace, not artwork

Genealogy of gestures:
- Futurist provocations
- Dada's cabaret chaos
- Happenings' scripted spontaneity
- Fluxus's simple instructions
- Body art's physical extremes
- Relational aesthetics' social forms

Marina Abramović sitting silent 736 hours. Chris Burden shot in arm. Carolee Schneemann pulling scroll from vagina. These aren't stunts but research - into presence, endurance, vulnerability, power.

Performance challenges commodification:
- Can't buy the action itself
- Documentation sells but isn't "it"
- Re-performance raises questions
- NFTs attempt digital capture
- Live-streaming changes audience

Contemporary performance explodes venues:
- Instagram as performance platform
- TikTok dances as scores
- Zoom performances in pandemic
- Gaming as performance space
- Protest as performance art
- Life itself performed online

Yet live presence remains irreplaceable. Breath in room. Shared risk. Collective witness. Time passing together. Performance reminds: art happens between humans, not objects.
