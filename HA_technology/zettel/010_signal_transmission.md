# Signal Transmission

## Core Insight
Signals are patterns that persist through space and time - information surfing on energy waves, meaning maintaining itself across distance and noise.

A signal is a pattern with purpose. It's not the medium - sound waves, electric pulses, light flashes. It's the modulation, the deviation from baseline that carries code. The carrier wave is just the vehicle; the signal is the passenger.

Transmission fights entropy. Every medium degrades, every channel adds noise. Yet signals persist through amplification, error correction, redundancy. We've learned to armor information against reality's erosion.

From smoke signals to 5G, from morse to streaming: same challenge. How to make a pattern here appear there, intact? Signal transmission is teleportation of structure, moving form without moving matter.
