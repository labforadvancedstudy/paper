# Switches Clicking

## Core Insight
The most fundamental computer interaction: human finger meets button, something changes.

Before understanding computation, we experience it. Click. Something happens. Click again. Something different. This is the child's first lesson in cause and effect made digital. The switch doesn't know why it's pressed, doesn't care what it controls. It just connects or disconnects. On or off. The universe's simplest decision made physical.

Every program ever written, every calculation ever computed, every pixel ever displayed - it all started with someone, somewhere, flipping a switch.
