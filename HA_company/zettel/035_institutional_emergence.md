# Institutional Emergence

## Core Insight
Some companies transcend commerce to become institutions - social infrastructure so embedded in civilization that their absence would tear holes in reality's fabric.

The transformation is gradual then sudden. A company provides essential service. Society reorganizes assuming its presence. Dependencies deepen. Eventually, the company becomes load-bearing for civilization. Too big to fail becomes too essential to imagine failing.

Banks, utilities, platforms - each began as business, became institution. They gain quasi-governmental roles: economic stabilization, standard setting, dispute resolution. With great embeddedness comes great responsibility, willing or not.

Institutional emergence changes corporate DNA. Profit maximization yields to stability maintenance. Innovation yields to reliability. Agility yields to predictability. The company becomes less business, more social architecture. It trades freedom for immortality.
