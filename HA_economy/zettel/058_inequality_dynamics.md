# Inequality Dynamics

## Core Insight
Inequality isn't just about differences in wealth - it's about self-reinforcing systems that turn small advantages into insurmountable chasms.

Start with two people, identical except one has $1000 and the other has $100. Equal percentage returns (say 10%) mean the gap grows from $900 to $990 to $1089... forever widening. This is Piketty's r > g: when capital returns exceed growth, inequality mechanically increases.

But it's not just math. Advantages compound socially. Rich kids get better education, better networks, better opportunities. They marry other rich kids, combining wealth. They live longer, passing more to heirs. Every advantage creates more advantages.

There's also the threshold effect. Below certain wealth, you pay penalties - overdraft fees, payday loans, buying in small quantities. Above certain wealth, you get subsidies - tax breaks, better interest rates, bulk discounts. The system taxes poverty and subsidizes wealth.

Yet some inequality seems necessary. Without rewards for effort and innovation, why strive? The question is how much. When does healthy competition become dynastic oligarchy? When do incentives become extraction?

Modern inequality has a new twist: winner-take-all markets. When technology scales infinitely, the best app developer can serve billions while the second-best serves none. Inequality isn't just growing; its nature is changing from gradual slopes to cliff faces.
