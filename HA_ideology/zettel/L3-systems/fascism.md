# Fascism

## Core Insight
The ideology of ultranationalist rebirth through violence - a worldview that promises collective redemption through strength, purity, and the destruction of enemies.

Fascism is notoriously hard to define because it's less a coherent philosophy than a syndrome of attitudes:
- Cult of tradition (mythic past was perfect)
- Rejection of modernism (despite using modern tech)
- Action for action's sake (thinking is emasculation)
- Disagreement is treason (unity through conformity)
- Fear of difference (the other corrupts)
- Appeal to frustrated middle class (squeezed from above and below)
- Obsession with plots (enemies everywhere)
- Enemies both strong and weak (terrifying but contemptible)
- Life is permanent warfare (peace is decadence)
- Contempt for the weak (social Darwinism)
- Cult of heroism (everyone must be ready to die)
- Machismo (including homophobia, misogyny)
- Selective populism (the leader interprets the will)
- Newspeak (impoverished vocabulary limits thought)

Fascism's emotional core:
- Humiliation (we were great, now diminished)
- Rage (at those who weakened us)
- Fear (of further degradation)
- Hope (for violent redemption)

It offers belonging through exclusion, meaning through struggle, identity through enemy. Unlike conservatism, it's revolutionary - seeking not to preserve but to forge a new order through will and violence.

The fascist leader embodies the nation's will. Democracy is weak division; fascism is strong unity. The movement matters more than any principle. Today's truth can be tomorrow's lie if the leader says so.

Historically specific yet eternally recurring, fascism adapts to each context while maintaining its emotional core.
