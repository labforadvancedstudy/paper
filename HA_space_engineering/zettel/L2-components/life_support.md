# Life Support

## Core Insight
Maintaining a bubble of Earth in the most un-Earth place possible - the systems that keep fragile water-based chemistry functioning in an environment that kills in seconds.

Life support is the ultimate fight against entropy. Every breath consumes oxygen and produces CO2. Every moment generates heat, moisture, and waste. Without constant intervention, the livable becomes lethal in minutes. It's mechanical metabolism.

The basic needs cascade complexity:
- Oxygen: 0.84 kg/person/day
- Water: 3.5 kg/person/day (if no recycling)
- Food: 0.62 kg/person/day (dry mass)
- Pressure: 14.7 psi (or 4.3 psi pure O2)
- Temperature: 18-24°C
- Humidity: 40-60%
- CO2 removal: < 0.5% concentration

The systems interweave:
- **ECLSS** (Environmental Control and Life Support)
- Oxygen generation (electrolysis, Sabatier)
- CO2 scrubbing (LiOH, molecular sieves)
- Water recovery (urine processor, condensate)
- Thermal control (radiators, heat pumps)
- Pressure regulation (tanks, valves, sensors)

The recycling imperative:
- Open loop: Bring everything (impossible for long missions)
- Partially closed: Recycle water and oxygen (ISS today)
- Closed loop: Complete recycling (the dream)
- Bioregenerative: Plants close the loop (complex)

Failure modes are nightmares:
- Apollo 13: CO2 scrubber incompatibility
- Mir: fire, collision, system degradation
- ISS: Ammonia leaks, pump failures
- All: Single contaminant can poison entire volume

The mass penalty is brutal:
- Every kg of hardware needs power
- Every watt needs cooling
- Every system needs backups
- Every backup adds complexity
- Complexity breeds failure

Life support is where human spaceflight gets real. Rockets are spectacular, but life support is survival.
