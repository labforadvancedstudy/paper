# Mutation

## Core Insight
Evolution's dice roll - errors in copying that accidentally write the future.

Every time DNA replicates, mistakes happen. About 1 error per 10 billion base pairs - incredibly rare but inevitable. Most do nothing. Some break things. A precious few improve things. These mistakes wrote every gene in every organism that ever lived.

Mutations are random but not uniform. UV light causes specific errors. Chemicals create predictable changes. Some DNA regions mutate faster (hotspots). But crucially: mutations don't know what's needed. A polar bear doesn't mutate white fur because it's cold - random mutations made some bears whiter, and white bears survived better.

The rate matters. Too fast = error catastrophe, organisms fall apart. Too slow = evolution stalls, extinction awaits. Life has evolved elaborate proofreading to hit the sweet spot: stable enough to survive, variable enough to adapt.

We are mutation museums. Every human carries ~60 new mutations not in their parents. Most harmless, accumulating like typos in a manuscript. But sometimes one typo changes everything - sickle cell, lactose tolerance, blue eyes. Mistakes that became features.
