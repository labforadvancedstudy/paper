# Divergent Evolution

## Core Insight
Interstellar distances don't just separate human populations in space - they create evolutionary laboratories where humanity splinters into multiple species, each adapted to their new world.

Evolution never stops. On Earth, gene flow keeps humanity relatively unified. But separate populations by light-years, add different gravities, atmospheres, and radiation levels, and wait a few thousand years. What emerges might not be recognizable as human.

Environmental pressures driving change:
- High gravity worlds: Shorter, denser bones, stronger hearts
- Low gravity: Taller, weaker, calcium loss issues
- High radiation: Enhanced DNA repair, maybe new skin
- Toxic atmospheres: Modified lungs, different blood
- Long nights: Enhanced vision, altered circadian rhythms

But it's not just physical:
- Isolation selects for different psychological traits
- Small populations amplify genetic drift
- Founder effects from original colonists
- Cultural selection for certain traits
- Potential genetic engineering acceleration

The timeline is brutal:
- 1,000 years: Noticeable differences
- 10,000 years: Difficulty interbreeding
- 100,000 years: Separate species
- 1 million years: Unrecognizable cousins

Interstellar civilization might not be human civilization at all - it might be a constellation of post-human species, each shaped by their star.
