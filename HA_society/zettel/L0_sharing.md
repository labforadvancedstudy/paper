# Sharing

## Core Insight
The fundamental social act of giving part of what you have to another - the seed of all cooperation.

Watch children in a sandbox. First, they clutch their toys. Then, hesitantly, one offers a shovel. Sharing begins. It's painful at first - "MINE!" - but something magical happens when the other child smiles and shares back.

Sharing is the first victory over selfishness, the first recognition that giving can create more than keeping. From sharing toys to sharing food, ideas, and eventually lives, this simple act builds civilizations.
