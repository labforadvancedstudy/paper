# Society as Organism

## Core Insight
The radical possibility that society isn't like an organism but IS an organism - we are cells in a being we can't perceive.

Consider: cities have circulatory systems (traffic), nervous systems (communication networks), digestive systems (supply chains), and immune systems (police/security). They grow, adapt, get sick, and sometimes die. Metaphor or description?

If society is an organism, what kind? Not biological - something new. An information organism, processing data through human nodes. A meaning organism, metabolizing symbols into structure. A time organism, existing across decades instead of space.

The cellular view shifts everything. Individual death isn't tragedy but normal cellular replacement. Mental illness might be society's dreams. Wars could be immune responses. Are civilizations competing organisms or organs in humanity's body?
