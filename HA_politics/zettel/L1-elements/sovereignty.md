# Sovereignty

## Core Insight
The final say - the political quality of having no higher earthly authority, the power to decide without appeal to another power.

Sovereignty is politics' theological moment. Just as medieval theologians said God needed no cause beyond Himself, sovereignty needs no justification beyond itself. "Because I am sovereign" ends arguments.

But sovereignty is paradoxical from birth. The sovereign power that makes law stands outside law (how else could it make law?). Yet lawless sovereignty is tyranny. The sovereign must be simultaneously above and within the system.

Classical formulations:
- Bodinian: sovereignty is indivisible
- Hobbesian: sovereignty is absolute
- Rousseauian: sovereignty belongs to the people
- Schmittian: sovereign is who decides the exception

Modern complications:
- Divided sovereignty (federalism)
- Pooled sovereignty (EU)
- Popular sovereignty (democracy's claim)
- Limited sovereignty (human rights)
- Graduated sovereignty (zones, exceptions)

The deeper issue: sovereignty assumes a final decider. But in complex systems, who decides who decides? Sovereignty infinitely regresses or arbitrarily stops. Every sovereign was made sovereign by something.

Yet sovereignty persists because politics needs finality. Endless appeal means no decision. Someone, somewhere must be able to say: "This is the decision. Period."
