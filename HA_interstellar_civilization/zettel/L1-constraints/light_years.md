# Light Years

## Core Insight
A light-year isn't just a distance - it's a temporal prison that makes the universe vast beyond comprehension and turns interstellar travel into an exercise in accepting cosmic loneliness.

The numbers break human intuition:
- 1 light-year = 9.46 trillion kilometers
- Nearest star: 4.2 light-years (Proxima Centauri)
- Milky Way diameter: 100,000 light-years
- Andromeda: 2.5 million light-years away

But the real insight isn't the distance - it's the time. When we see Proxima Centauri, we see it as it was 4.2 years ago. When we look at Andromeda, we see it 2.5 million years in the past. The night sky is a time machine showing us the universe's history, not its present.

For interstellar civilization, this means:
- Messages take years to decades between stars
- No real-time communication possible
- Each colony essentially alone
- News arrives years after events
- Civilizations could rise and fall between hellos

The light-year transforms space from a place to a time. Interstellar civilization isn't just about crossing distance - it's about accepting isolation.
