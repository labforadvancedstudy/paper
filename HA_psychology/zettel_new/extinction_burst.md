# Extinction Burst

The temporary increase in a behavior when reinforcement stops, like frantically pressing a broken elevator button. The last desperate attempt before giving up.

## The Pattern
1. Behavior previously reinforced
2. Reinforcement stops
3. Brief increase in frequency/intensity
4. Gradual decline
5. Behavior extinguishes

## Everyday Examples
- Child tantrums escalating before stopping
- Repeatedly clicking unresponsive computer mouse
- Texting ex more before finally stopping
- Vending machine eating money â†’ hitting it harder

## Why It Happens
The brain thinks: "This used to work. Maybe I'm not doing it hard enough?"

## Clinical Importance
Therapists warn parents: "It will get worse before it gets better." Understanding extinction bursts prevents giving in at the worst moment.
