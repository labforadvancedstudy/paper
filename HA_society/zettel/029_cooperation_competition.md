# Cooperation Competition

Cooperate within, compete between.

Chimp troops: Brothers in arms.
Until meeting other troop.

Dolphins: Alliances within alliances.
Like geopolitics with fins.

Cleaner fish: Cooperate with clients.
Compete with other cleaners.

Coopetition shapes society.
Us vs them = social glue.
