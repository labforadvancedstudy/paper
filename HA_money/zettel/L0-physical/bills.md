# Bills

## Core Insight
Paper money is humanity's first triumph of belief over substance - we collectively agreed that special paper equals value, and miraculously, it worked.

Hold a bill up to the light. See those intricate patterns, watermarks, security threads? All that complexity to protect... paper. The bill itself costs pennies to make, yet we'll work hours for it. This is monetary magic: value exists because we all pretend it does, and our pretending makes it real.

The psychology of bills:
- Larger denominations feel more valuable (even though they're the same paper)
- Crisp bills feel worth more than crumpled ones
- Different colors/sizes help our brains categorize value
- Serial numbers make each one unique (like snowflakes of trust)
- They wear out, reminding us value is temporary

Bills taught humanity that money doesn't need intrinsic value - it just needs collective agreement. Once we learned paper could be money, the path to credit cards and cryptocurrency was inevitable.
