# The Langlands Program - Grand Unification

## Core Insight
The Langlands program predicts a vast web of correspondences between number theory, representation theory, and geometry - mathematics' theory of everything.

## Content
Langlands saw a pattern: disparate areas of mathematics encode the same information differently. His program predicts precise dictionaries between these encodings.

The correspondences:
- Galois representations ↔ Automorphic forms
- Number fields ↔ Reductive groups
- L-functions mediate between sides
- Local-global compatibility

Why it matters:
- Explains "coincidences" in number theory
- Unifies algebraic and analytic
- Generalizes class field theory
- Predicts new phenomena

Successes:
- GL₁: class field theory
- GL₂: modular forms (Wiles' proof of Fermat)
- Function fields: geometric Langlands
- Local Langlands: mostly proven

The geometric version:
- Curves replace number fields
- D-modules replace automorphic forms
- Derived categories appear
- Physics connections (gauge theory)

Modern developments:
- p-adic Langlands
- Langlands for Brauer groups
- Relative Langlands
- Langlands beyond endoscopy

The vision: all of mathematics' deepest structures are reflections of one underlying reality, viewed from different angles.
