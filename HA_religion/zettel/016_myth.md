# Myth

## Core Insight
Stories that are more than true - narratives that create meaning rather than just describing facts.

"It's just a myth" misunderstands myth. Myth isn't false story but founding story - the narrative that tells a people who they are, why they exist, where they're going. Facts inform; myths transform.

Essential features:
- **Archetypal patterns** - same stories everywhere
- **Multiple meanings** - literal, moral, spiritual
- **Living quality** - grows with retelling
- **Orientation function** - positions us in cosmos
- **Timeless time** - "once upon always"

Universal myth patterns:
- Creation from chaos/void
- Paradise lost through transgression  
- Hero's journey to restore
- Death and resurrection
- Return to source

These aren't primitive science but perennial wisdom. The Big Bang is how universe began; Genesis is why it matters. Evolution explains bodies; myths explain souls.

Living in myth vs studying myth: fish discovering water. We swim in myths we don't recognize - progress, individual rights, romantic love, scientific materialism. These organize reality so thoroughly we mistake them for reality itself.

Myths are lies that tell the truth, facts that transcend factuality, stories more real than history.
