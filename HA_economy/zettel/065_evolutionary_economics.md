# Evolutionary Economics

## Core Insight
Evolutionary economics sees the economy not as a machine seeking equilibrium, but as an ecosystem where ideas, technologies, and organizations evolve through variation, selection, and replication.

Darwin meets Adam Smith. Instead of species competing for resources, we have businesses competing for profits. Instead of genes, we have routines and technologies. Instead of natural selection, we have market selection. The fittest survive, but fitness is defined by the market environment.

This explains what equilibrium models can't. Why do inefficient firms persist? (They occupy niches.) Why does innovation happen in bursts? (Punctuated equilibrium.) Why do dominant designs emerge? (Lock-in through increasing returns.)

Schumpeter glimpsed this with creative destruction, but evolutionary economics goes further. It models how novelty emerges (mutation/innovation), spreads (replication/diffusion), and either thrives or dies (selection/competition).

The approach illuminates technology evolution. The QWERTY keyboard survived not because it's optimal, but because it won the replication race. Path dependence, lock-in, and network effects are natural in evolutionary thinking.

But here's the twist: unlike biological evolution, economic evolution is partially directed. Firms try to innovate strategically. Governments try to shape selection environments. We're both subject to evolution and trying to control it.

This raises profound questions. If economies evolve, what are they evolving toward? Greater complexity? Higher consciousness? Or just whatever survives in the current environment?
