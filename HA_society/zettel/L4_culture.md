# Culture

## Core Insight
The invisible water we swim in - the shared meanings, practices, and assumptions that make a random collection of humans into a people.

Culture is what makes a Japanese bow different from an American handshake, both serving the same function (greeting) in radically different forms. It's why some societies fear death while others celebrate it, why time moves linearly here and cyclically there.

The anthropological shock: things you thought were human nature are just your culture. Romantic love, individual achievement, three meals a day - all cultural constructions other societies do without or differently.

Culture is humanity's greatest invention and prison. It enables cooperation among millions of strangers (we all know what money means) while limiting what we can imagine (try thinking a truly non-cultural thought).
