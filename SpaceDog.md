The following text contains somewhat far-fetched and science fiction-like elements.

# Agenda:
1. Establishing Humanity as a Multi-planetary Species to Prevent Extinction:

- Establish a sustainable presence on multiple planets:

  - Identify and colonize planets with habitable conditions.
  - Develop advanced space travel technologies for efficient interplanetary transportation.
  - Construct self-sufficient colonies capable of supporting human life and promoting long-term prosperity.
- Foster global cooperation and collaboration:

  - Establish international agreements and organizations dedicated to multi-planetary expansion.
  - Share resources, knowledge, and expertise among nations to ensure the success of the endeavor.
  - Promote a sense of shared purpose and responsibility for the future of humanity.

2. Overcoming Human Extinction via Cloning:

- Address the ethical concerns surrounding cloning:

  - Develop clear guidelines and regulations for the responsible use of cloning technology.
  - Ensure the safety and well-being of cloned individuals throughout their lives.
  - Engage in public discourse and education to address societal concerns and misconceptions.
- Advance cloning technology for human reproduction:

  - Enhance the efficiency and safety of cloning procedures.
  - Develop methods for cloning individuals with specific genetic traits or desired characteristics.
  - Ensure the genetic diversity of the cloned population to prevent genetic bottlenecking.
- Integrate cloned individuals into society:

  - Provide cloned individuals with equal rights and opportunities as naturally-born humans.
  - Combat discrimination and prejudice against cloned individuals.
  - Promote social acceptance and understanding of cloned individuals as valuable members of society.

# Execution

1. Earn 300 trillion won
3. Launch a super global lottery. Mega jackpots burst daily, awarding 10 billion won each  
4. To receive the 10 billion won, there are conditions. Winners must pledge the following:
    4.1 Provide their DNA to create clones
    4.2 The clones will be rapidly grown, educated with maximum knowledge within a year, and then sent on Mars exploration missions 
    4.3 This is to ensure a steady population supply for Martian colonies
    4.4 Contact will be lost for 5 years, after which winners can communicate with their settled clones on Mars
5. Plans for sending to Mars
    5.1 Cooperate with SpaceX
    5.2 Establish an independent space exploration company

# Plan 1

1. Hold a daily global lottery to select winners. Ensure equal opportunity for all, but only those passing physical/mental exams can participate.
2. Harvest cells from winners to create cloned humans. They will legally be the winners' children and carry on lives on Earth.  
3. Winners undergo 1-2 years of intense training to learn necessary knowledge and skills for Martian life.
4. Trained winners board rockets to Mars in stages. Basic facilities will have been pre-built on Mars.
5. Mars immigrants will engage in solar/nuclear power generation, hydrogen production, agriculture, etc. to build a self-sufficient initial settlement.  
6. Settlers will adapt to the new environment and lay the groundwork for humanity's first interplanetary civilization.
7. The clones remaining on Earth will be raised with special status and support as descendants of the "Martian pioneers". Some may join the Mars missions upon reaching adulthood.
