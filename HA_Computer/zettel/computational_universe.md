# Computational Universe

## Core Insight
What if reality isn't made of particles but of computations? The universe as a cosmic computer calculating itself into existence.

Digital physics suggests everything - space, time, matter, energy - emerges from information processing at the smallest scales. Particles are persistent patterns in the computation. Forces are update rules. Time is the cosmic clock cycle.

This isn't metaphor but hypothesis: reality might literally be computational. Not running on a computer, but being computation itself. We're not discovering the universe's laws; we're reverse-engineering its source code.
