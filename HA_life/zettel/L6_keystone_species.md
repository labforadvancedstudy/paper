# Keystone Species

## Core Insight
Some species are load-bearing walls - remove them and the whole ecosystem collapses.

Not all species are created equal. In any ecosystem, a few species have impacts far beyond their numbers. Remove most species and the system adjusts. Remove a keystone species and everything changes.

Sea otters eat sea urchins. Seems simple. But without otters, urchins explode, devour kelp forests, eliminating habitat for hundreds of species. One predator maintains an entire underwater forest.

Wolves in Yellowstone: killed deer, yes. But also changed where deer grazed, allowing trees to grow, stabilizing riverbanks, literally changing the course of rivers. Predators as landscape architects.

The lesson: ecosystems aren't democracies. They're structures with critical supports. Protecting biodiversity means identifying and protecting these pillars. Sometimes saving one species saves hundreds.
