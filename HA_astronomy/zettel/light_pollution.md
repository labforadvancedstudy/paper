# Light Pollution

## Core Insight
Humanity's artificial lights have stolen the night sky - what was universal human heritage visible to all is now hidden from 80% of Earth's population, erasing our cosmic context.

For all human history until ~1900, everyone saw the Milky Way nightly. Now, most humans never see it. Light pollution - excessive artificial illumination - creates skyglow that drowns out stars. From city centers, only a few dozen brightest stars remain visible of the thousands our ancestors knew.

This isn't just aesthetic loss. Nocturnal ecosystems suffer - migrating birds collide with lit buildings, sea turtles crawl away from the ocean, predator-prey relationships shift. Human circadian rhythms, evolved under dark nights, are disrupted. Astronomers must place telescopes in remote locations or space. Cultural connections to the night sky vanish. Children grow up never wondering about stars they can't see. Light pollution is reversible - proper shielding, appropriate brightness, and conscious choices could restore the night. Some communities create dark sky preserves. But for most humans, the universe has been replaced by a glowing orange dome. We've accidentally edited the cosmos from human experience.
