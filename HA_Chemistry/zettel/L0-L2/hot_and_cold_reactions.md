# Hot and Cold Reactions

## Core Insight
Some mixings warm your hands, others chill them - energy hiding in bonds, released or absorbed when molecules rearrange.

Mix vinegar and baking soda - the container cools. Light a match - instant heat. Activate a hand warmer - gradual warmth. Instant cold packs for injuries - sudden chill. Chemistry isn't just about substance change, it's about energy flow.

Every bond stores energy. Breaking bonds requires energy (making things cold), forming bonds releases energy (making things hot). A child feeling their cup get warm when mixing plaster is sensing bond formation in real-time.

This is thermodynamics at its most tangible. The universe's energy budget playing out in your hands. Heat flowing from reaction to fingers, or fingers to reaction. The first law experienced through skin.
