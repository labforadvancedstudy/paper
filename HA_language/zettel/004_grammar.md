# Grammar

## Core Insight
The operating system of language - rules that turn word soup into meaning.

## The Hidden Rules

Every speaker knows grammar without knowing they know it. You can't say "Dog the brown quick jumped" - it feels wrong. Why? Grammar.

Universal grammar components:
- **Syntax**: Word order rules
- **Morphology**: Word formation rules
- **Phonology**: Sound combination rules
- **Semantics**: Meaning combination rules
- **Pragmatics**: Usage rules

Core grammatical categories (all languages have versions):
- **Nouns**: Things, people, places, ideas
- **Verbs**: Actions, states, occurrences  
- **Modifiers**: Adjectives, adverbs
- **Function words**: The, of, and, to

Grammar is democracy - it emerges from use, not decree.
