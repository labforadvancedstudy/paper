# Level 6: The Prison House of Language - Structure and Sign
*When words became the cage and key*

> "The limits of my language mean the limits of my world." - Wittgenstein

> "There is nothing outside the text." - Derrida

## Sophia in Vienna

1922, Café Central. Sophia (how is she here? let's not ask) sips melange, reading Wittgenstein's Tractatus:

"The world is all that is the case. The world is the totality of facts, not of things."

She nearly spills her coffee. He's not describing reality - he's describing how language carves up reality. The mesh of the net determines what fish we catch.

At the next table, Vienna Circle debates. Carnap shouts: "Metaphysics is meaningless! Only verifiable propositions have sense!"

Schlick counters: "But is THAT proposition verifiable?"

Sophia smiles. Philosophy is eating its own tail again. But this time, it knows it.

## The Linguistic Turn

L5 asked: "How does mind know reality?"
L6 asks: "How does language create what we can know?"

**The Revolution**:
- Thought doesn't use language - thought IS language
- We don't speak language - language speaks us
- Reality isn't described by words - it's constituted by them

This changes everything. Again.

## Early Wittgenstein: Logic as Scaffold

Tractatus builds reality from logical atoms:

1. World = totality of facts
2. Facts = states of affairs
3. Language pictures facts
4. Logic shows world's structure
5. What can't be said clearly must be passed over in silence

Perfect logical language would mirror reality perfectly. But...

"My propositions are elucidatory: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless."

The ladder self-destructs after climbing.

## Logical Positivism: Science as Only Truth

Vienna Circle radicalizes:

**Verification Principle**: Meaningful statements are either:
- Analytic (logic/math - true by definition)
- Synthetic (empirical - verifiable by experience)
- Everything else is nonsense

**Casualties**:
- Ethics: Nonsense! (just emotions)
- Aesthetics: Nonsense! (just pleasure)
- Metaphysics: Nonsense! (unverifiable)
- Religion: Nonsense! (untestable)

They're trying to purify philosophy. Make it scientific. Eliminate confusion. Noble goal. Impossible task.

## Ordinary Language: Philosophy as Therapy

Later Wittgenstein rebels against his younger self:

"Don't ask for meaning, ask for use!"

**Language Games**:
- Ordering, describing, joking, praying
- Each has its own rules
- Meaning = use in context
- No essence of language

**Philosophy's Task**: Not solving problems but dissolving them. Show the fly the way out of the bottle.

"A philosophical problem has the form: I don't know my way about."

## Structuralism: The Hidden Patterns

Saussure discovers language is a system:

**Sign = Signifier + Signified**
- Signifier: Sound/mark "tree"
- Signified: Concept [tree]
- Arbitrary connection!

**Meaning from Difference**:
- "Cat" means not-dog, not-hat, not-car...
- No positive terms, only differences
- Language is pure relation

This spreads everywhere:
- Levi-Strauss: Myths have grammar
- Lacan: Unconscious structured like language
- Barthes: Culture is language

Everything becomes text to decode.

## Analytic Philosophy: Precision Tools

Philosophy becomes technical:

**Russell's Theory of Descriptions**:
"The present King of France is bald" - meaningful but false? No! Meaningless because no referent.

**Quine's Indeterminacy**:
"Gavagai!" (natives point at rabbit)
Means: Rabbit? Undetached rabbit parts? Rabbit-stage?
Translation is interpretation all the way down.

**Davidson's Charity**:
To understand others, assume they're mostly right. Otherwise, no communication possible.

They're engineers of concepts, debugging language.

## Speech Acts: Words That Do Things

Austin discovers performatives:

"I promise" doesn't describe - it promises
"I thee wed" doesn't report - it weds
"I name this ship" doesn't state - it names

Some words ARE actions. Language doesn't just describe reality - it changes it.

## Chomsky: Universal Grammar

Deep structure underlies all languages:

- Children learn impossibly fast
- Must have innate language faculty
- Universal grammar in genes
- Infinite sentences from finite rules

Mind comes pre-wired for language. But which came first - thought or language?

## Sophia's Seminar

Professor Sophia teaches "Language and Reality" at Cambridge:

"Consider: 'Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.'
- Grammatically perfect
- Semantically nonsense
- But you understood it!

What does this show? Grammar creates meaning-space. Some spaces are empty but still there. Language has more room than reality."

Student objects: "But mathematical language is precise!"

"Really? Define 'number.' Go ahead. I'll wait."

## Continental Developments

Across the channel, French think differently:

**Merleau-Ponty**: Language is embodied
- Words have flesh
- Meaning lives in gesture
- Speaking and thinking intertwine

**Levinas**: The saying beyond the said
- Ethics precedes ontology
- Face-to-face breaks language
- Infinity in finite speech

They're finding language's limits from inside.

## The Crisis

By 1960s, both traditions hit walls:

**Analytics**: Language purified but bloodless
**Continentals**: Language rich but vague

Sophia writes: "We've discovered language is both prison and key. But every description of the prison uses the prison's own bars. Every key is made of cage."

## Bridge to L7

May 1968, Paris. Students riot. Graffiti: "Structures don't march in the streets!"

Sophia, impossibly old, lectures at Sorbonne:

"We found language structures thought. But who structures language? Power? History? Biology? Chance?

Next generation must go deeper. Not just how language works, but how it breaks. Not just structure, but what escapes structure. Not just the said, but the unsayable."

A young Derrida takes notes. He writes one word: "Différance."

**The Real Mystery Is...**

How did meaningless matter create meaningful language? How do arbitrary sounds become ideas? How does syntax create semantics?

Maybe language is consciousness externalizing itself to see what it thinks. Maybe every word is the universe naming its parts. Maybe meaning is matter's way of mattering.

"Or maybe," Sophia writes, "we're just monkeys who learned to lie elaborately."

The truth is always both. But language can't say both at once. That's its prison. And its freedom.

*"L6 discovered we live in language like fish in water. We can't jump out to see reality 'directly.' But fish who know they're wet swim differently than fish who don't."*
