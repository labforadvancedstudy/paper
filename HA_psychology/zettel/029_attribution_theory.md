# Attribution Theory

Explaining why things happen.

Dimensions:
- Internal vs External (me vs situation)
- Stable vs Unstable (always vs sometimes)
- Controllable vs Uncontrollable

Fundamental attribution error:
Others: Internal causes
Self: External causes

Self-serving bias:
Success = Me
Failure = Not me

Culture matters:
Individualist vs collectivist differences.
