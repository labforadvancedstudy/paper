# Memory Retrieval

Finding what's stored.

Retrieval cues:
- Context: Same place helps
- State: Same mood helps
- Priming: Related concepts help

Forgetting curve:
Rapid initial loss.
Then stabilizes.

Retrieval practice > Restudying.
Testing strengthens memory.

Tip-of-tongue:
Know it's there, can't access.
Partial activation.
