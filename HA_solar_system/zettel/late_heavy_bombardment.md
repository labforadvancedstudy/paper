# Late Heavy Bombardment

## Core Insight
Four billion years ago, the Solar System went through violent adolescence - a rain of asteroids and comets that cratered every solid surface and may have delivered life's ingredients to Earth.

The Moon's face tells the story. Those dark maria and bright highlands record a cataclysm. About 600 million years after the Solar System formed, something destabilized asteroid orbits. Maybe the giant planets migrated, scattering smaller bodies like gravitational pinballs. For millions of years, impacts rained down on inner planets. Earth was pummeled. The Moon was scarred. Mars was battered.

But destruction brought creation. These impactors may have delivered Earth's water, organic molecules, even life itself (or its precursors). The bombardment's timing is suspicious - it ended just before life's first evidence appears on Earth. Did the bombardment prevent earlier life, or did it seed life? The Late Heavy Bombardment transformed sterile worlds into potential homes, written in craters we still see today.
