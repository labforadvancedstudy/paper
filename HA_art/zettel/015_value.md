# Value

## Core Insight
The grayscale between black and white - value creates depth, mood, and readability, proving that art can live without color but dies without value contrast.

Strip any image of color, leave only values - it still works. Strip values, leave only color - it fails. This hierarchy reveals truth: we see value before color. It's why black-and-white photography remains powerful, why sketches communicate, why shadows define form.

Value creates:
- Depth (lighter recedes, darker advances)
- Focus (high contrast draws eye)
- Mood (high key = light, low key = dark)
- Volume (gradations show roundness)
- Drama (sharp contrasts excite)
- Atmosphere (close values merge)

Artists study value through:
- Squinting (reduces color, reveals value)
- Black-white photos of paintings
- Value scales (typically 9-10 steps)
- Thumbnail sketches
- Single-light source studies

Masters understood value's power. Rembrandt painted light emerging from dark. Caravaggio created divine drama through value. Japanese woodcuts achieved complexity with minimal value steps. They knew: control value, control viewer's eye.

Digital artists struggle here. Screens emit light, confusing value judgment. Print surprises - what glowed on screen muddles on paper. Calibration helps but doesn't solve the translation problem.

Value mistakes reveal themselves instantly:
- Forms flatten
- Focal points vanish
- Mood disappears
- Depth collapses
