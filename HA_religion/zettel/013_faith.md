# Faith

## Core Insight
Faith is trust beyond evidence - the leap across the gap between what we can prove and what we choose to live by.

Distinct from belief (cognitive assent), faith is existential commitment. You can believe in gravity intellectually; faith is stepping off the cliff trusting the parachute. Faith begins where knowledge ends. It's the "nevertheless" that follows every doubt.

Faith operates through:
- Choosing without certainty
- Acting despite doubt
- Trusting beyond reason
- Committing before proof
- Persisting through darkness

Consider everyday faith:
- Sitting in chairs without inspection
- Eating food trusting it's safe
- Loving someone who could betray
- Having children in uncertain world
- Starting ventures without guarantees

Religious faith simply extends this:
- Trust in ultimate goodness
- Act as if meaning exists
- Love despite suffering
- Hope beyond death
- Believe in More

Faith isn't blind - it sees clearly the gaps in evidence and chooses to build bridges anyway. It's not irrational - it recognizes reason's limits and ventures beyond. It's not certain - it embraces mystery as companion.

Faith is courage in the face of cosmic uncertainty.
