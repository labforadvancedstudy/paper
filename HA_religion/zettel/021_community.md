# Community

## Core Insight
Religion is never just individual - it's the binding that creates a people from persons.

"Religion" comes from religare - to bind together. The solitary mystic is exception; the congregation is rule. We believe in groups because the sacred is too heavy for one person to carry.

Religious community creates:
- **Shared identity** - we are the chosen/saved/enlightened
- **Mutual reinforcement** - your faith strengthens mine
- **Collective ritual** - doing together what seems silly alone
- **Social pressure** - conformity to belief and behavior
- **Support network** - caring for members
- **Meaning maintenance** - keeping the story alive

Watch how individual doubt dissolves in group certainty. Alone, questions multiply. Together, singing, the questions quiet. Community is religion's immune system against skepticism.

But community also constrains. The heretic is cast out not for being wrong but for threatening cohesion. Unity matters more than truth. The group must survive even if individuals suffer.

Religious community is humanity's most successful binding technology. It creates peoples from strangers, meaning from chaos, identity from anonymity. "I" becomes "we" becomes "us against them."
