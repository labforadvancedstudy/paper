# Curiosity Drive

## Core Insight
Curiosity is the brain's information hunger - we're addicted to reducing uncertainty.

That itch to peek behind the curtain, click the link, or ask "but why?" - curiosity rewards us with dopamine just for seeking. It's why spoilers hurt: they rob us of the pleasure of discovery. Babies stare at impossible things longer because their prediction engine screams "UPDATE ME!" We're all scientists from birth, running experiments on reality.
