# Loop

## Core Insight
The pattern of repetition that gives computers their power, transforming finite code into infinite possibility.

Loops are the fundamental construct that separates computation from mere calculation. While a calculator performs one operation at a time, a computer can repeat operations millions of times, transforming small instructions into powerful algorithms. The loop is what allows a few lines of code to process gigabytes of data or simulate centuries of time.

At its essence, a loop combines three elements: initialization, condition, and progression. It starts somewhere, checks if it should continue, and moves toward completion. This simple pattern appears in countless forms - for loops counting through numbers, while loops waiting for conditions, foreach loops traversing collections. Each variant optimizes for different use cases, but all share the core concept of controlled repetition.

Loops reveal the temporal nature of computation. Each iteration represents a discrete moment in time, a step in the program's journey through its problem space. The loop body executes in sequence, accumulating effects and transforming state. Time in a program is measured not in seconds but in iterations.

The danger of loops lies in their power. An incorrect termination condition creates an infinite loop, consuming resources forever. Off-by-one errors skip crucial iterations or access invalid memory. The challenge is not just making loops work, but making them correct, efficient, and comprehensible.
