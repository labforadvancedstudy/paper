# Sharing

## Core Insight
The first economic miracle: voluntarily making "mine" into "ours" creates more than we lose.

Sharing is economics' great paradox. I have less pie, but somehow we're both better off. A child sharing their cookie discovers the fundamental economic truth: value isn't just in things, it's in relationships.

Sharing creates:
- **Trust** - I'll share now, believing you'll share later
- **Reciprocity** - the gift creates a debt
- **Insurance** - I share my plenty against my future lack
- **Alliance** - sharing makes us "us"
- **Surplus** - somehow 1+1 > 2

Watch children learn to share. First, forced sharing ("Share with your sister!"). Then strategic sharing ("If I share my toy, maybe I'll get to play with theirs"). Finally, genuine sharing - the joy of seeing another's joy.

This scales up:
- Families share meals
- Tribes share hunts
- Nations share knowledge
- Humanity shares... what?

The deepest economic truth: sharing creates wealth that hoarding can't. The pie shared is bigger than the pie hoarded. Economics begins when we discover sharing isn't loss - it's multiplication.
