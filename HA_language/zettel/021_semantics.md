# Semantics
## Core Insight
The study of meaning itself - how arbitrary symbols connect to concepts, and how those concepts relate to reality.

## The Meaning Machine

Semantics asks: How does "dog" mean DOG? It's not onomatopoeia. The word doesn't bark.

**Types of Meaning**:
1. **Denotation**: Dictionary meaning
2. **Connotation**: Associated feelings/ideas
3. **Reference**: What it points to in the world
4. **Sense**: The concept, not the thing

**Semantic Relations**:
- **Synonymy**: big/large (same meaning)
- **Antonymy**: hot/cold (opposite)
- **Hyponymy**: rose → flower (subset)
- **Meronymy**: wheel → car (part of)
- **Polysemy**: bank (river/money) - related meanings
- **Homonymy**: bat (animal/sports) - unrelated

**Compositional Semantics**:
How parts create whole meaning:
- "red car" = RED(CAR)
- "John loves Mary" = LOVE(JOHN, MARY)
- "Every student read a book" = ∀x(STUDENT(x) → ∃y(BOOK(y) ∧ READ(x,y)))

**Semantic Change**:
- **Broadening**: "holiday" (holy day → any vacation)
- **Narrowing**: "meat" (any food → animal flesh)
- **Amelioration**: "knight" (boy → noble warrior)
- **Pejoration**: "silly" (blessed → foolish)

**Truth Conditions**:
"Snow is white" is true iff snow is white
- Meaning = conditions for truth
- Understanding = knowing when true
