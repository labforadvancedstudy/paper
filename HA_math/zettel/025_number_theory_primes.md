# Number Theory and the Prime Atoms

## Core Insight
Prime numbers are the atoms of arithmetic - every number is built from primes in exactly one way.

## Content
The integers hide infinite mysteries. Number theory studies these mysteries, with primes as the central characters: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13...

Fundamental theorem of arithmetic: every integer > 1 factors uniquely into primes. This seems obvious but is profound - it fails in other number systems.

Prime mysteries:
- Infinitely many primes (Euclid's proof is eternal)
- Gaps between primes: sometimes 2, sometimes millions
- Twin primes: infinitely many pairs like (11,13)?
- Goldbach: every even number sum of two primes?

Distribution of primes:
- Prime number theorem: π(x) ~ x/ln(x)
- Riemann hypothesis: zeros of ζ(s) control prime distribution
- Random-like but not random
- Patterns emerge at scale

Modern connections:
- RSA cryptography: factoring is hard
- Elliptic curves: geometry meets arithmetic
- Modular forms: symmetries encode arithmetic
- Langlands program: grand unification

Number theory techniques:
- Modular arithmetic: clock math
- Diophantine equations: integer solutions
- Analytic methods: calculus meets primes
- Algebraic methods: structures over numbers

Primes seem simple - just numbers with no divisors. But they encode some of mathematics' deepest mysteries.
