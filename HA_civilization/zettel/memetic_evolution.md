# Memetic Evolution

## Core Insight
Ideas use human brains to reproduce themselves, just like genes use bodies - civilization is the ecosystem where memes fight for survival.

A good joke spreads. A useful technique spreads. A compelling belief spreads. Ideas that are better at spreading... spread better. This is evolution, but the replicators aren't DNA - they're thoughts.

Memes don't care about truth or human welfare. They care about copying themselves. A false but catchy idea beats a true but boring one. This is why civilizations believe absurdities - not because people are stupid, but because absurd ideas can be excellent replicators.

Civilization isn't just humans cooperating. It's a battlefield where ideas compete for brain-space, using us as their substrate. We think we have ideas. Maybe ideas have us.
