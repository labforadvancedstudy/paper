# Moon Formation

## Core Insight
The Moon was born from planetary trauma - a Mars-sized world smashing into early Earth, creating our companion from the debris of unimaginable violence.

The Giant Impact Hypothesis explains the Moon's existence through catastrophe. 4.5 billion years ago, a protoplanet called Theia collided with Earth at 40,000 km/h. The impact vaporized rock, liquefied Earth's surface, and threw debris into orbit. This debris, mostly from Earth's mantle, coalesced into the Moon within perhaps a century - cosmic instant birth from planetary caesarean.

Evidence supports this violent origin. Moon rocks match Earth's isotopic fingerprints but lack iron (which sank to Earth's core). The Moon's orbit aligns with impact physics. Computer simulations recreate the event. This birth explains why Earth-Moon is almost a double planet system, why the Moon lacks volatiles (boiled away), why Earth's day was once 5 hours (angular momentum from impact). In our serene Moon, we see frozen evidence of the Solar System's violent youth.
