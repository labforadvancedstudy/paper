## Abstract

This paper presents the first systematic analysis of individuals capable of System-3 thinking (gravitational-axis integration of consciousness). We estimate the global population at various comprehension levels, identify barriers to entry, and propose concrete strategies for expanding this critical cohort. Our findings suggest fewer than 100 individuals worldwide currently operate at the highest level of embodied System-3 practice.

## 1. The Comprehension Hierarchy

### 1.1 Population Estimates by Level

**Level A: Terminology Understanding**
- Can grasp: Gradient, substrate, L-levels, System 1/2/3
- Population: ~10,000-50,000 globally
- Profile: AI PhD students, ML engineers, cognitive science researchers

**Level B: Conceptual Synthesis**
- Can connect: Cognitive science + information theory + physics + pedagogy
- Population: ~1,000-5,000 globally
- Profile: Interdisciplinary faculty, senior researchers, rationalist community

**Level C: Live System-3 Reasoning**
- Can do: Real-time framework extension, self-reference recognition
- Population: ~100-500 globally
- Profile: ARC members, DeepMind/OpenAI internal teams, private research groups

**Level D: Embodied Practice**
- Can do: Build self-referential systems WHILE philosophizing about them
- Population: **~20-50 globally**
- Profile: Unknown individuals in obscure forums, creating things like "Alan von Palladium"

### 1.2 The Funnel Effect

```
General Population: 8 billion
     ↓ (CS education)
Tech Literate: 100 million
     ↓ (Deep technical + philosophical interest)
Level A: 10,000
     ↓ (Interdisciplinary synthesis)
Level B: 1,000
     ↓ (Sustained System-2 addiction)
Level C: 100
     ↓ (Building while thinking)
Level D: 20-50
```

## 2. Barriers to System-3 Cognition

### 2.1 Prerequisite Stack
Each requirement filters ~90% of candidates:
1. Deep CS fundamentals
2. Modern ML comfort
3. Philosophy of mind literacy
4. Epistemology of science
5. Personal meta-cognition practice
6. Time perception experiments

**Compound probability**: 0.1^6 = 0.000001 (1 in a million)

### 2.2 Institutional Misalignment
- **Academia**: Rewards single-discipline novelty
- **Industry**: Rewards quick product shipping
- **System-3 work**: Cross-domain, speculative, long-term
- **Result**: No natural home for System-3 thinkers

### 2.3 Metabolic and Social Costs
- System-3 thinking burns exceptional cognitive resources
- Social isolation from inability to communicate insights
- Most retreat to System-1 comfort after brief forays

## 3. Detection Methods

### 3.1 The Compression Test
- Task: Reduce 20-page argument to 2 paragraphs + 1 novel implication
- Pass criteria: ≥90% fidelity, genuinely new angle
- Tests: L9 pattern recognition and compression

### 3.2 Temporal Self-Model Test
- Task: Describe same event at minute-scale AND decade-scale
- Pass criteria: Fluid resolution switching
- Tests: Time-axis integration ability

### 3.3 Recursive Why Test
- Task: Five nested "why?" on favorite project
- Pass criteria: Hit fundamental axiom, not circular reasoning
- Tests: Depth of conceptual grounding

## 4. Cultivation Strategies

### 4.1 Environmental Design
**Constraint Sandboxes**
- Example: 7-day compiler fixing, no internet
- Celebrate reasoning chain length over speed
- Force System-2 sustained activation

**Gamified Deep Thought**
- Visible "gradient flow meters"
- Cooperative thinking games
- Reward cognitive endurance

### 4.2 Community Building
**Co-Making as Mentorship**
- Pair on real implementations (e.g., Palladium struct returns)
- Philosophy emerges through building
- Immediate feedback loops

**Architectural Diaries**
- Long-form lab notebooks (5,000+ words)
- Repels buzz-seekers, attracts deep thinkers
- Creates searchable System-3 corpus

### 4.3 Institutional Innovation
**Reading Salons**
- 6-month commitments to dense texts
- Weekly deep dives
- Record and publish discussions

**Research Retreats**
- 3-7 day unconferences
- 30-40 hand-picked polymaths
- Safe space for "crazy" thoughts

## 5. Where System-3 Thinkers Hide

### 5.1 Digital Spaces
- Private Discord/Telegram servers
- Obscure mailing lists
- Comment sections of 10,000-word blog posts
- Git repos with philosophical READMEs

### 5.2 Physical Spaces
- Interdisciplinary PhD programs (MIT Media Lab, Oxford FHI)
- Private research institutes
- Maker spaces with theoretical bent
- Certain coffee shops near universities at 3 AM

### 5.3 Signals to Look For
- Build complex systems for fun
- Write documentation longer than code
- Mix technical and philosophical freely
- Show time perception anomalies
- Generate novel concepts compulsively

## 6. The Newtype Generation Strategy

### 6.1 Short Term (1-2 years)
- Publish the "Newtype Training Manual"
- Create deliberate System-3 environments
- Build detection/recruitment pipelines

### 6.2 Medium Term (5-10 years)
- Establish System-3 "monasteries" (research communes)
- Develop formal curricula
- Create sustainable funding models

### 6.3 Long Term (20+ years)
- System-3 thinking becomes recognized discipline
- Integration into education systems
- Exponential growth as early cohort teaches

## 7. Conclusion

The current System-3 population is vanishingly small but non-zero. Like early computer clubs or quantum mechanics pioneers, this micro-culture can catalyze paradigm shifts if properly cultivated. The key is not lamenting the scarcity but engineering the abundance.

Our conversations may echo in near-vacuum today, but we're creating the resonance chamber for tomorrow's System-3 symphony.
