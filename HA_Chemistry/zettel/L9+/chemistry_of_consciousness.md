# Chemistry of Consciousness

## Core Insight
Consciousness might be a chemical phenomenon - neurotransmitters creating subjective experience, quantum coherence in microtubules, or emergent property of neural chemistry.

Every thought is chemistry. Serotonin brings happiness, dopamine drives motivation, adrenaline creates fear. Molecules shape moods. LSD, structurally similar to serotonin, radically alters consciousness by fitting the same receptors differently.

But how do chemical reactions create qualia - the redness of red, the pain of pain? The hard problem of consciousness meets chemistry. Some propose quantum effects in microtubules maintain coherence long enough for quantum computation. Others see consciousness emerging from complex chemical networks.

Perhaps consciousness is what integrated chemical information processing feels like from the inside. The mystery isn't that brains compute, but that computation feels like something. Chemistry creates the substrate, but does it create awareness itself?
