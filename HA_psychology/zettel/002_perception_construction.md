# Perception Construction

Brain doesn't receive reality. Builds it.

Construction process:
- Bottom-up: Sensory data
- Top-down: Expectations
- Mix: Your reality

Optical illusions prove it.
Same input, different perceptions.

Perceptual constancy:
- Size (things don't shrink with distance)
- Color (white paper in shadow still "white")
- Shape (door still rectangle at angle)

We see what we predict, not what is.
