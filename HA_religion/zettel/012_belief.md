# Belief

## Core Insight
Accepting as true what cannot be proven - the cognitive commitment that enables all religion.

Belief is strange. "I believe the sun will rise" is prediction based on experience. "I believe in God" is something else entirely - accepting what cannot be verified, often against evidence.

Religious belief involves:
- **Assent without proof** - taking it as true anyway
- **Persistence despite doubt** - believing through darkness
- **Community reinforcement** - we believe together
- **Emotional investment** - belief feels true
- **Behavioral consequences** - belief shapes action

Children believe naturally - in Santa, in monsters, in magic. Adult religious belief retains this quality: the willingness to accept a story about how reality really works despite inability to check.

But belief isn't passive. It actively constructs experience. Believe in demons, see demonic influence. Believe in angels, see angelic intervention. Believe in meaningless chaos, see exactly that. Belief is a lens that shapes what comes through.

The paradox: belief creates some of what it believes in. Believe in community of saints, act accordingly, create community. Belief can be self-fulfilling prophecy.
