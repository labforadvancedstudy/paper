# Ancient Calendars

## Core Insight
Humanity's first astronomy application was timekeeping - transforming celestial cycles into calendars that organized agriculture, religion, and society, making civilization possible.

The Moon's phases gave us months. The Sun's return to the same position gave us years. But 12 lunar months (354 days) don't equal a solar year (365.24 days). This fundamental mismatch drove millennia of calendar innovation. Every ancient civilization struggled with this cosmic irregularity.

Egyptians used Sirius's heliacal rising to predict Nile floods, creating a 365-day calendar. Mayans developed interlocking cycles of stunning complexity. Chinese calendars harmonized lunar and solar cycles through careful intercalation. Stonehenge and similar monuments were calendar computers in stone, marking solstices and lunar extremes. The Gregorian calendar's leap year rules (skip century years unless divisible by 400) achieve accuracy of one day per 3,000 years. Behind every calendar lies careful astronomical observation. Time itself is astronomy made practical - we live our lives by celestial rhythms, even if we've forgotten the sky.
