# Groups

## Core Insight
The magical threshold where individuals become something more - a collective entity with its own mind and power.

Three people are just three people. But add shared purpose, time together, and inside jokes, and something emerges: a group. It has moods (try cheering up a depressed team), makes decisions no individual would make (mob mentality, groupthink), and survives member changes.

Groups create their own physics. Conformity pressure, diffusion of responsibility, social loafing - individuals behave differently in groups than alone. The terrifying and beautiful truth: groups can make saints of sinners and sinners of saints.

The size matters: dyads (two) are intense but fragile, triads introduce politics, small groups enable intimacy, large groups require structure. At ~150 people (Dunbar's number), informal organization breaks down.
