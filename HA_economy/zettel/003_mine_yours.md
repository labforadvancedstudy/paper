# Mine/Yours

## Core Insight
The first economic boundary: the violent birth of property in a toddler's "MINE!"

Before any law, before any philosophy of property rights, there's a two-year-old clutching a toy, screaming "MINE!" This is property at its most raw - the exclusion impulse that makes economics possible.

Without mine/yours:
- No accumulation (why save what anyone can take?)
- No trade (can't exchange what isn't owned)
- No investment (can't improve what might be grabbed)
- No responsibility (not mine = not my problem)

The mine/yours boundary creates:
- **Security** - I can keep what I need
- **Exchange** - your apple for my orange
- **Conflict** - disputes over boundaries
- **Identity** - I am what I own
- **Care** - we maintain what's ours

Every property law, from Hammurabi to blockchain, is just elaborate notation on a toddler's possessive grip. The fascinating part: we must learn to share, but sharing only makes sense after "mine" exists.

Even communist societies must solve "mine/yours" - they just move the boundary (personal vs private property). The boundary always exists. Economics happens at that boundary.
