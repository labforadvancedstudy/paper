# Symbolism

## Core Insight
Objects speaking in tongues - where things mean more than themselves, creating visual languages that communicate across time and culture through shared understanding.

Symbols operate through agreement. Skull means death because we agree. But agreement shifts:
- Universal symbols (sun, water, fire)
- Cultural symbols (cross, swastika, flag)
- Personal symbols (private meanings)
- Contextual symbols (depends on placement)
- Evolving symbols (meaning changes)

Layers accumulate:
- Literal level: what's depicted
- Allegorical: story suggested
- Moral: lesson implied
- Anagogical: spiritual meaning
- Personal: viewer's association

Art history tracks symbol evolution:
- Medieval: religious codebook
- Renaissance: classical additions
- Romantic: nature symbolism
- Modern: private symbols
- Contemporary: corporate logos

Symbol literacy declining/changing:
- Religious symbols less recognized
- Brand symbols universal
- Emoji creating new vocabulary
- Memes as symbol systems
- Hashtags as meaning markers

Artists navigate between:
- Clear communication (shared symbols)
- Mystery creation (private symbols)
- Cultural quotation (borrowed symbols)
- Symbol subversion (meaning reversal)
- New symbol invention (risky)

Digital proliferates symbols:
- Icons replace words
- Visual shortcuts multiply
- Cultural mixing accelerates
- Context collapse online
- Misreading increases

Problem: symbol inflation. Everything symbolic, nothing means. Overinterpretation paralyzes. Sometimes pipe just pipe. Balance needed between meaning and being.
