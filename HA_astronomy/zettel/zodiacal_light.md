# Zodiacal Light

## Core Insight
The faint pyramid of light after sunset or before sunrise isn't atmospheric - it's sunlight reflecting off dust in the Solar System's plane, making visible the debris disk we inhabit.

From dark sites, keen observers see a triangular glow along the ecliptic after twilight fades. This zodiacal light puzzled astronomers for centuries. Some thought it was Earth's atmosphere. Others proposed it was the Sun's extended atmosphere. The truth emerged gradually: it's sunlight scattering off interplanetary dust particles concentrated in the ecliptic plane.

This dust comes from comets and asteroid collisions, spiraling slowly sunward via Poynting-Robertson effect (photon pressure). Particles range from micrometers to millimeters. The gegenschein - a faint glow opposite the Sun - is backscattered light from this same dust. We live inside a dusty disk, continuously replenished and swept clean. Spacecraft measure these particles directly. They damage satellites, create meteor showers when Earth crosses debris streams, and trace our Solar System's ongoing evolution. The zodiacal light is our debris disk made visible - a reminder that planet formation never truly ends.
